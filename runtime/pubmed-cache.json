      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Arterio-venous fistulas (AVF), the gold standard for hemodialysis vascular access, are known to alter cardiac morphology and circulatory hemodynamics. We present a prospective case series of patients after creation of an AVF, explore the timeline for changes in their cardiac morphology, and detail considerations for clinicians. Patients were recruited in 2010 at multiple centers immediately prior to the creation of an upper-arm AVF and the initiation of hemodialysis. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance images were taken at intake before the creation of the AVF, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. Image segmentation was used to measure left ventricular volume and mass, left atrial volume, and ejection fraction. Eight patients met eligibility criteria. All eight patients had a net increase in left ventricular mass over enrollment, with a mean increase of 9.16 g (+2.96 to +42.66 g). Five participants had a net decrease in ejection fraction, with a mean change in ejection fraction of -5.4% (-21% to +5%). Upon visual inspection the patients with the largest ejection fraction decrease had noticeably hypertrophic and dilated ventricles. Left atrial volume change was varied, decreasing in five participants, while increasing in three participants. Changes in morphology were present at 6-month follow-up, even in patients who did not maintain AVF patency for the entirety of the 6-month period. All patients included in this prospective case series had increases in left ventricular mass, with variability in the effects on the ejection fraction and left atrial volume. As left ventricular mass is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality, further research to determine appropriate vascular access management in both end-stage kidney disease and kidney transplant populations is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin K activates matrix Gla protein (MGP), a key inhibitor of vascular calcification. There is a high prevalence of sub-clinical vitamin K deficiency in patients with end-stage kidney disease. A parallel randomized placebo-controlled pilot trial was designed to determine whether 10&#xa0;mg of phylloquinone thrice weekly versus placebo modifies coronary artery calcification progression over 12 months in patients requiring hemodialysis with a coronary artery calcium score (CAC) &#x2265;30 Agatston Units (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01528800). The primary outcome was feasibility (recruitment rate, compliance with study medication, study completion and adherence overall to study protocol). CAC score was used to assess calcification at baseline and 12 months. Secondary objectives were to explore the impact of phylloquinone on vitamin K-related biomarkers (phylloquinone, dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP and the Gla-osteocalcin to Glu-osteocalcin ratio) and events of clinical interest. A total of 86 patients with a CAC score&#xa0;&#x2265;30 Agatston Units were randomized to either 10&#xa0;mg of phylloquinone or a matching placebo three times per week. In all, 69 participants (80%) completed the trial. Recruitment rate (4.4 participants/month) and medication compliance (96%) met pre-defined feasibility criteria of&#xa0;&#x2265;4.17 and&#xa0;&#x2265;90%, respectively. Patients randomized to phylloquinone for 12 months had significantly reduced levels of dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP (86% reduction) and increased levels of phylloquinone and Gla-osteocalcin to Glu-osteocalcin ratio compared with placebo. There was no difference in the absolute or relative progression of coronary artery calcification between groups. We demonstrated that phylloquinone treatment improves vitamin K status and that a fully powered randomized trial may be feasible.",

      "abstract": "The effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease who are at risk for disease progression are not well understood. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial was designed to assess the effects of treatment with empagliflozin in a broad range of such patients. We enrolled patients with chronic kidney disease who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> of body-surface area, or who had an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Patients were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of progression of kidney disease (defined as end-stage kidney disease, a sustained decrease in eGFR to &lt;10 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, a sustained decrease in eGFR of &#x2265;40% from baseline, or death from renal causes) or death from cardiovascular causes. A total of 6609 patients underwent randomization. During a median of 2.0 years of follow-up, progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 432 of 3304 patients (13.1%) in the empagliflozin group and in 558 of 3305 patients (16.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.82; P&lt;0.001). Results were consistent among patients with or without diabetes and across subgroups defined according to eGFR ranges. The rate of hospitalization from any cause was lower in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.95; P&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003), but there were no significant between-group differences with respect to the composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes (which occurred in 4.0% in the empagliflozin group and 4.6% in the placebo group) or death from any cause (in 4.5% and 5.1%, respectively). The rates of serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. Among a wide range of patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression, empagliflozin therapy led to a lower risk of progression of kidney disease or death from cardiovascular causes than placebo.

      "abstract": "Outpatient hyperkalemia is a common problem with potentially deadly consequences. Potassium level thresholds to treat outpatient hyperkalemia are unstandardized and variable, leaving health care providers to rely on their own clinical judgment. This narrative review highlights the challenges of outpatient hyperkalemia management and includes recommendations for future studies that may standardize treatment, improve patient outcomes, and optimize health care utilization. PubMed, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of identified articles were used to include English, peer-reviewed studies and guidelines for this review. This narrative review examines outpatient hyperkalemia from both a laboratory and clinical perspective. In addition to peer-reviewed literature, guidelines and expert consensus statements were included to highlight the inconsistencies and paucity of evidence that health care providers rely on to make clinical decisions. There are multiple reasons why outpatient hyperkalemia management is both challenging and sub-optimal. Clinicians must discern if the potassium level result is accurate and, if so, does the result warrant referral to the emergency department. Factitious hyperkalemia, or falsely elevated potassium level results due to analytical errors, occurs frequently, but there are no ways to identify it other than for hemolyzed samples. Additionally, guidelines and expert panels are inconsistent on the thresholds for treatment and the management of hyperkalemia. Finally, there are inconsistencies between laboratories as to when and how providers are notified of results, and the suggested thresholds for urgent management. A study that integrates the expertise of clinical biochemists and clinicians is needed to inform evidence-based guidelines for the management of outpatient hyperkalemia. This was a comprehensive review of what is known and what still needs to be understood for the management of outpatient hyperkalemia. A formal tool to assess the quality of the included studies was not used and selection bias may have occurred.

Plusieurs raisons peuvent expliquer pourquoi la prise en charge de l&#x2019;hyperkali&#xe9;mie ambulatoire est &#xe0; la fois difficile et sous-optimale. Les cliniciens doivent juger eux-m&#xea;mes si le r&#xe9;sultat du potassium est exact et, dans l&#x2019;affirmative, d&#xe9;terminer s&#x2019;il justifie l&#x2019;aiguillage du patient vers les urgences.

Aussi, les lignes directrices et les groupes d&#x2019;experts ne s&#x2019;entendent pas sur les seuils de traitement et de prise en charge de l&#x2019;hyperkali&#xe9;mie.

      "abstract": "Kidney disease is present in almost half of Canadian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and it is also the most common first cardiorenal manifestation of T2D. Despite clear guidelines for testing, opportunities are being missed to identify kidney diseases, and many Canadians are therefore not receiving the best available treatments. This has become even more important given recent clinical trials demonstrating improvements in both kidney and cardiovascular (CV) endpoints with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone. The goal of this document is to provide a narrative review of the current evidence for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that supports this new standard of care and to provide practice points. An expert panel of Canadian clinicians was assembled, including 9 nephrologists, an endocrinologist, and a primary care practitioner. The information the authors used for this review consisted of published clinical trials and guidelines, selected by the authors based on their assessment of their relevance to the questions being answered. Panelists met virtually to discuss potential questions to be answered in the review and agreed on 10 key questions. Two panel members volunteered as co-leads to write the summaries and practice points for each of the identified questions. Summaries and practice points were distributed to the entire author list by email. Through 2 rounds of online voting, a second virtual meeting, and subsequent email correspondence, the authors reached consensus on the contents of the review, including all the practice points. It is critical that DKD be identified as early as possible in the course of the disease to optimally prevent disease progression and associated complications. Patients with diabetes should be routinely screened for DKD with assessments of both urinary albumin and kidney function. Treatment decisions should be individualized based on the risks and benefits, patients' needs and preferences, medication access and cost, and the degree of glucose lowering needed. Patients with DKD should be treated to achieve targets for A1C and blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade and treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors are also key components of the standard of care to reduce the risk of kidney and CV events for these patients. Finerenone should also be considered to further reduce the risk of CV events and chronic kidney disease progression. Education of patients with diabetes prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors and/or finerenone is an important component of treatment. No formal guideline process was used. The practice points are not graded and are not intended to be viewed as having the weight of a clinical practice guideline or formal consensus statement. However, most practice points are well aligned with current clinical practice guidelines. L&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale est pr&#xe9;sente chez pr&#xe8;s de la moiti&#xe9; des patients canadiens atteints de diab&#xe8;te de type 2 (DT2). Il s&#x2019;agit &#xe9;galement de la premi&#xe8;re manifestation cardior&#xe9;nale la plus fr&#xe9;quente du DT2. Bien qu&#x2019;il existe des lignes directrices claires pour son d&#xe9;pistage, des occasions de diagnostiquer l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale sont manqu&#xe9;es, ce qui fait en sorte que de nombreux Canadiens ne re&#xe7;oivent pas les meilleurs traitements disponibles. Cette pr&#xe9;occupation a pris de l&#x2019;importance puisque de r&#xe9;cents essais cliniques ont d&#xe9;montr&#xe9; des am&#xe9;liorations dans les param&#xe8;tres r&#xe9;naux et cardiovasculaires (CV) avec la prise de fin&#xe9;r&#xe9;none, un antagoniste non st&#xe9;ro&#xef;dien des r&#xe9;cepteurs min&#xe9;ralocortico&#xef;des (nsMRA), et d&#x2019;inhibiteurs du cotransporteur de glucose de sodium 2 (SGLT2). L&#x2019;objectif de cet article est de fournir une revue narrative des donn&#xe9;es probantes actuelles appuyant cette nouvelle norme de soins pour le traitement de l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale diab&#xe9;tique (IRD), ainsi que des points de pratique. Un groupe d&#x2019;experts compos&#xe9; de cliniciens canadiens, dont neuf n&#xe9;phrologues, un endocrinologue et un prestataire de soins primaires, a &#xe9;t&#xe9; form&#xe9;. Les auteurs de cette revue ont utilis&#xe9; des lignes directrices et des essais cliniques publi&#xe9;s comme sources; ceux-ci ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; choisis sur la base d&#x2019;une &#xe9;valuation de leur pertinence pour les questions auxquelles ils avaient r&#xe9;pondu. Les pan&#xe9;listes se sont r&#xe9;unis virtuellement pour discuter de potentielles questions &#xe0; r&#xe9;pondre dans le cadre de cette revue, et se sont entendus sur dix questions cl&#xe9;s. Deux membres du panel se sont port&#xe9;s volontaires pour &#xea;tre co-responsables et r&#xe9;diger les r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;s et les points de pratique pour chacune des questions identifi&#xe9;es. Ces derniers ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; distribu&#xe9;s par courriel &#xe0; l&#x2019;ensemble des auteurs. Apr&#xe8;s deux tours de vote en ligne, une deuxi&#xe8;me r&#xe9;union virtuelle et la correspondance &#xe9;lectronique qui a suivi, les auteurs sont parvenus &#xe0; un consensus sur le contenu de la revue narrative, y compris sur tous les points de pratique. Il est essentiel que l&#x2019;IRD soit diagnostiqu&#xe9;e le plus t&#xf4;t possible afin de pr&#xe9;venir de fa&#xe7;on optimale la progression de la maladie et les complications qui y sont associ&#xe9;es.

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) improve glycemic control and promote weight loss in type 2 diabetes (DM2) and obesity. We identified studies describing the metabolic benefits of GLP-1RA in end-staged kidney disease (ESKD) and kidney transplantation. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that investigated the metabolic benefits of GLP-1RA in ESKD and kidney transplantation. We summarized the effect of GLP-1RA on measures of obesity and glycemic control, examined adverse events, and explored adherence with therapy. In small RCTs of patients with DM2 on dialysis, liraglutide for up to 12 weeks lowered HbA1c by 0.8%, reduced time in hyperglycemia by &#x223c;2%, lowered blood glucose by 2&#xa0;mmol/L and reduced weight by 1-2&#xa0;kg, compared with placebo. In prospective studies inclusive of ESKD, 12 months of semaglutide reduced HbA1c by 0.8%, and contributed to weight losses of 8&#xa0;kg. In retrospective cohort studies in DM2 and kidney transplantation, 12 months of GLP-1RA lowered HbA1c by 2%, and fasting glucose by &#x223c;3&#xa0;mmol/L compared with non-use, and in some reports, weight losses of up to 4&#xa0;kg were described. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were most commonly reported, with hypoglycemia described with GLP-1RA in hemodialysis, particularly in those using insulin. GLP-1RA are growing in popularity in those with DM2 and obesity. In small RCTs and observational cohort studies modest glycemic and weight benefits have been described in ESKD and transplantation, but GI side effects may limit adherence. Larger and longer term studies of GLP-1RA remain important.",

      "abstract": "The availability and accessibility of patient-centered weight management programs is critical to mitigate the increasing prevalence of obesity in people living with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Little is known about the availability of contemporary programs that can safely and effectively support individuals living with obesity and CKD across North America. We sought to identify weight management programs specific to those with CKD and explore their safety, affordability, and adaptability to this patient population. We also identified the barriers and facilitators of identified programming including their accessibility to real-world patients (eg, cost, access, support, and time). Environmental scan of weight management programs. North America. People living with CKD. We identified weight management programs and associated barriers and facilitators, via an Internet-based search of commercial, community-based, and medically supervised weight management programming. We also conducted a gray literature search and contacted weight management experts and program facilitators to explore strategies as well as their barriers and facilitators. We identified 40 weight management programs available to people living with CKD across North America. Programs were commercial (n = 7), community-based (n = 9), and medically supervised (Canada n = 13, U.S n = 8) in origin. Three programs were specifically tailored to CKD (n = 3). In addition to formal programs, we also identified online nutritional resources and guidelines for weight loss in CKD (n = 8), and additional strategies (self-management tools, group orientated programs, moderate energy restrictions in conjunction with exercise and Orlistat) for weight loss from the gray literature (n = 3). Most common barriers were difficulty accessing some of the suggested nutritious food options due to the high cost, lack of support from family, friends and health practitioners, the time commitment required to participate, and the exclusion from weight management programs due to unique dietary needs for the CKD population. Most common facilitators were programs that were patient-centered, evidence-based, and offered both group and individual formats. Although our search criteria were broad, it is possible that we did not capture all weight management programs available across North America. This environmental scan has generated a resource list of existing safe and effective programs for or adaptable to people with CKD. This information will inform future efforts to develop and deliver CKD-specific weight management programs to patients living with comorbid disease. Engaging people living with CKD to understand the acceptability of these programs, is an important focus for future research.

      "abstract": "Most patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) appreciate the importance of exercise and would like to increase their physical activity; however, they report a few key barriers, including (1) lack of physician advice to do so, (2) lack of safe and convenient programs (ie, appropriate for home or neighborhood), and (3) cost. Importantly, patients indicated in a previous survey that they would prefer an exercise program that improves muscle strength and symptoms, and are less interested in cardiovascular disease prevention. To test the feasibility of a simple, prescribed exercise program using Nordic walking poles in patients with ESKD treated with dialysis. Randomized multicenter pilot trial of an exercise intervention that includes Nordic walking poles, personalized physician exercise prescriptions, pedometers, and access to exercise videos, compared with standard of care, in patients being treated with maintenance dialysis. Multicenter tertiary care centers in Canada. Ambulatory adult patients with ESKD treated with peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis (HD) for at least 6 months at participating sites are potentially eligible. Inclusion criteria include ability to use Nordic walking poles (either de novo or in place of mobility aid) and to provide informed consent in English or in French. Exclusion criteria include (1) any absolute contraindication to exercise, (2) baseline step count &gt;8000 steps/day, (3) planned living donor kidney transplant, and (4) participation in another interventional trial that may affect the results of this study. This is a randomized multicenter pilot trial of an exercise intervention that consists of a prescription to exercise using Nordic walking poles, a pedometer to track activity, and access to exercise videos, with the comparator of standard of care (dialysis unit staff encouragement to exercise) in patients being treated with maintenance dialysis. Randomization is concealed and uses a 1:1 ratio for group assignment. Our specific aims are to determine the feasibility of patient recruitment, adherence to the exercise program (verified by step counts), and efficacy of the intervention on patient-important outcomes that were assessed as a priority by patients in a prior survey-specifically strength, fatigue, and sleep. We record days spent in hospital and loss of independent living to inform sample size calculations for a definitive trial of exercise in patient with ESKD treated with dialysis. Adverse events are closely monitored. Primary: Our recruitment goal is 90 to 150 patients over 27 months; adherence success will be defined if &gt;75% of randomized patients, excluding those who are transplanted or deceased, achieve &gt;80% of their prescribed steps at 6 and 12 months. Secondary Efficacy Outcomes: (1) strength-hand grip strength and 5 times sit to stand, (2) energy-Short Form (SF)-36 vitality subscale, and (3) sleep-Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index will be assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Trial recruitment started before the COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic led to many interruptions and delays. Online exercise Web sites and a tailored video were added to the protocol to encourage activity when participants were unable or reluctant to walk in public places. This trial was designed to include ambulatory patients with ESKD and does not address the burden of disease in patients with very restricted mobility. NCT03787589. La plupart des patients atteints d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale terminale (IRT) comprennent l&#x2019;importance de l&#x2019;exercice physique et souhaitent augmenter leur niveau d&#x2019;activit&#xe9;. Ils signalent toutefois quelques obstacles, notamment 1) le manque de conseils m&#xe9;dicaux pour le faire; 2) le manque de programmes s&#xe9;curitaires et faciles (c.-&#xe0;-d. pouvant &#xea;tre suivis &#xe0; la maison ou dans le quartier); et 3) les co&#xfb;ts. Il convient de noter que les patients avaient indiqu&#xe9; dans une enqu&#xea;te pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;dente pr&#xe9;f&#xe9;rer un programme d&#x2019;exercices am&#xe9;liorant la force musculaire et les sympt&#xf4;mes li&#xe9;s &#xe0; la maladie, et &#xea;tre moins int&#xe9;ress&#xe9;s par la pr&#xe9;vention des maladies cardiovasculaires.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are associated with a reduced risk of CV events and death in non-dialysis patients and in patients with established CV disease but n-3 PUFAs have not been evaluated in the high risk KFRT patient population. This multicentre randomised, placebo controlled, parallel pragmatic clinical trial tests the hypothesis that oral supplementation with n-3 PUFA, when added to usual care, leads to a reduction in the rate of serious CV events in haemodialysis patients when compared with usual care plus matching placebo. A target sample size of 1100 KFRT patients will be recruited from 26 dialysis units in Canada and Australia and randomised to n-3 PUFA or matched placebo in a 1:1 ratio with an expected intervention period of at least 3.5 years. The primary outcome to be analysed and compared between intervention groups is the rate of all, not just the first, serious CV events which include sudden and non-sudden cardiac death, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease events.

      "abstract": "Prolonged bleeding from arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) associates with worse outcomes; Within the hemodialysis unit these outcomes include anemia and quality of life disruptions, and outside the hemodialysis unit includes fatal hemorrhage. However, various guidelines for AVF/AVG bleeding management inside and outside the hemodialysis unit lack consensus. A scoping review was conducted of four databases, from inception to 17 February 2024. The study population was hemodialysis patients experiencing bleeding from AVF or AVG. Studies that assessed non-operative management were included. Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria. Most (14/16) addressed post-cannulation bleeding from AVF/AVG within the dialysis unit. Compared with standard dressings, hemostatic dressings (chitosan-, cellulose- or thrombin-based) decreased post-cannulation bleeding time at arterial and venous site 35.7%-84.0% (<i>P&#xa0;</i>&lt;&#xa0;.05) and 38.5%-78.7% (<i>P&#xa0;</i>&lt;&#xa0;.05), respectively. Use of chitosan-based dressings decreased percentage of patients bleeding 4-min post-cannulation by 16.3%-39.2%. One pilot observational study demonstrated no access thromboses or infections with short-term use of a compression device within the hemodialysis unit. However, the role of compression devices and tourniquets within the dialysis unit remains unclear, despite widespread use. Long-term AVF/AVG survival was not reported in any study. Limited research confirms that devices are effective in prevention of catastrophic out-of-hospital bleeding. It remains uncertain if device availability enhances patient confidence in managing out-of-hospital bleeding. This may impact patient choices around dialysis modality, access and transplant, but this remains uncertain. In hemodialysis patents with bleeding from AVF/AVG, several alternative dressings or devices decrease post-cannulation bleeding time within the hemodialysis unit. Existing research has not established criteria on when it might be appropriate to use specialized dressings. There is very limited research on methods to control bleeding from AVF/AVG outside the hemodialysis unit. More data are required before evidence-based guidelines can be made. Recommendations for future research are provided.",

      "abstract": "In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, had positive cardiorenal effects in patients with chronic kidney disease who were at risk for disease progression. Post-trial follow-up was designed to assess how the effects of empagliflozin would evolve after the discontinuation of the trial drug. In the active trial, patients with chronic kidney disease were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin (10 mg once daily) or matching placebo and were followed for a median of 2 years. All the patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of at least 20 but less than 45 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> of body-surface area or an eGFR of at least 45 but less than 90 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> with a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 200. Subsequently, surviving patients who consented were observed for 2 additional years. No trial empagliflozin or placebo was administered during the post-trial period, but local practitioners could prescribe open-label SGLT2 inhibitors, including open-label empagliflozin. The primary composite outcome was kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death as assessed from the start of the active-trial period to the end of the post-trial period. Of the 6609 patients who had undergone randomization in the active trial, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial period. During this period, the use of open-label SGLT2 inhibitors was similar in the two groups (43% in the empagliflozin group and 40% in the placebo group). During the combined active- and post-trial periods, a primary-outcome event occurred in 865 of 3304 patients (26.2%) in the empagliflozin group and in 1001 of 3305 patients (30.3%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.87). During the post-trial period only, the hazard ratio for a primary-outcome event was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). During the combined periods, the risk of kidney disease progression was 23.5% in the empagliflozin group and 27.1% in the placebo group; the risk of the composite of death or end-stage kidney disease was 16.9% and 19.6%, respectively; and the risk of cardiovascular death was 3.8% and 4.9%, respectively. There was no effect of empagliflozin on death from noncardiovascular causes (5.3% in both groups). In a broad range of patients with chronic kidney disease at risk for progression, empagliflozin continued to have additional cardiorenal benefits for up to 12 months after it was discontinued.

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic notably disrupted care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) care, necessitating a rapid shift to telemedicine. Despite the growing use of telemedicine, the impact of this transition on patients' experiences, particularly in Canada and considering sociocultural factors, remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate patients with CKD perspectives on telemedicine versus in-person care and to offer recommendations for enhancing telemedicine services. The objective was to understand patients with CKD views on telemedicine clinics during the pandemic compared to traditional in-person clinics. This was a qualitative descriptive study employing semi-structured interviews. This study was conducted in general nephrology and multidisciplinary kidney care clinics in London, Canada. The study population was English-speaking patients with CKD with at least one in-person nephrology visit before March 15, 2020, and one telemedicine appointment after March 30, 2020. Interviews were conducted using a structured guide, with transcripts analyzed line-by-line by 3 independent reviewers through directed content analysis. Themes were identified and agreed upon through group consensus. Interviews with 12 participants revealed 5 key themes: (1) convenience; (2) building connection and trust; (3) necessity of in-person care; (4) role of family or caregivers; and (5) preferences for clinic types. Most participants (11/12) valued the convenience of telemedicine, noting similar levels of care compared to in-person visits. However, they found it easier to establish personal connections in face-to-face appointments. Most (8/12) preferred in-person visits if their condition worsened. Overall, a combination of in-person and telemedicine was favored, with a preference for video over telephone. The study's focus on one academic nephrology center in Ontario and predominantly white participants limits broader applicability. Additionally, recall bias may affect the findings due to the interview-based design. Telemedicine will remain integral to CKD care, with a hybrid model combining in-person and telemedicine preferred. Integrating patient feedback into future telemedicine practices is essential to enhance flexibility, access, and patient satisfaction. La pand&#xe9;mie de COVID-19 a profond&#xe9;ment perturb&#xe9; la prise en charge de l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale chronique (IRC), ce qui a forc&#xe9; un passage rapide vers la t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine. Malgr&#xe9; son utilisation croissante, on a peu explor&#xe9; les r&#xe9;percussions de cette transition sur l&#x2019;exp&#xe9;rience des patients, en tenant compte des facteurs socioculturels, particuli&#xe8;rement au Canada. Cette &#xe9;tude a pour objectif d&#x2019;explorer les perspectives des patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC sur la t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine par rapport aux consultations en personne et de proposer des recommandations pour am&#xe9;liorer les services de t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine.

Les entretiens ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; men&#xe9;s &#xe0; l&#x2019;aide d&#x2019;un guide structur&#xe9;, puis les transcriptions ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; analys&#xe9;es ligne par ligne par trois &#xe9;valuateurs ind&#xe9;pendants selon une analyse dirig&#xe9;e du contenu. Les th&#xe8;mes ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; identifi&#xe9;s et adopt&#xe9;s par consensus de groupe.

La plupart des participants (11/12) ont appr&#xe9;ci&#xe9; le confort de la t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine, rapportant des niveaux de soins similaires &#xe0; ceux des visites en personne. Ils ont cependant trouv&#xe9; plus facile d&#x2019;&#xe9;tablir une relation personnelle lors des rendez-vous en personne. Une majorit&#xe9; de participants (8/12) a mentionn&#xe9; pr&#xe9;f&#xe9;rer les visites en personne si leur &#xe9;tat s&#x2019;aggravait. Dans l&#x2019;ensemble, les participants pr&#xe9;f&#xe9;raient une combinaison de consultations en personne et en t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine, avec une pr&#xe9;f&#xe9;rence pour les consultations par vid&#xe9;o plut&#xf4;t que par t&#xe9;l&#xe9;phone. L&#x2019;extrapolation des r&#xe9;sultats de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude est limit&#xe9;e par le fait que celle-ci a &#xe9;t&#xe9; men&#xe9;e dans un seul centre universitaire de n&#xe9;phrologie en Ontario et aupr&#xe8;s de personnes majoritairement de race blanche. Un biais de rappel pourrait &#xe9;galement affecter les r&#xe9;sultats en raison de la conception fond&#xe9;e sur des interviews. La t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine continuera de faire partie int&#xe9;grante des soins de l&#x2019;IRC, avec une pr&#xe9;f&#xe9;rence pour un mod&#xe8;le hybride combinant les consultations en personne et la t&#xe9;l&#xe9;m&#xe9;decine.

      "abstract": "Obesity has a major impact on health and health care, particularly in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The objective was to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes of people living with CKD and obesity (defined by a body mass index [BMI] &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in Canada. Population-based cohort study using linked administrative health data (ICES). Adults aged 18 year and older with CKD G1-5D who had a height and weight recorded during a visit to an academic hospital in London Ontario Canada, between January 2010 and December 2019. CKD as defined by CKD 3A or higher. BMI as defined by weight kg/m<sup>2</sup>. As a primary interest, we described the percentage of patients with CKD across different BMI categories (&lt;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), as well as their demographic and clinical profiles. As secondary interests, we followed patients until January 1, 2022 to summarize: (1) the percentage with CKD G3 who had kidney disease progression (50% decline from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) by BMI category, (2) the percentage with CKD G3-4 who developed kidney failure (initiation of maintenance dialysis or an eGFR of &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) by BMI category, (3) the percentage with CKD G4-G5D who received a kidney transplant by BMI category, and (4) post-transplant outcomes in those transplanted over the study period, by BMI category. We performed similar analyses across CKD risk categories. Of the 198&#x2009;151 patients included, the percentage with obesity defined by a BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> increased from CKD G1 to CKD G4 (ie, 37% of those with CKD G1 had a BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs 40.9% of CKD G4). In CKD G5D and CKD T, the prevalence of high BMI appeared to drop (only ~38% had a BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> across groups). Across CKD categories, those with a BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> appeared to have more comorbidities, use more health care resources, and have more socioeconomic disparities than those with lower BMIs. Although secondary outcome events were limited, those with G3-4 with a BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> appeared to have a higher risk of CKD progression and those with CKD G5D with BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were less likely to receive transplant over the study period. Interestingly those transplanted with a BMI &#x2265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> appeared to have fewer post-transplant complications. We also observed an \"obesity-paradox\" in the risk of mortality, with high BMI appearing protective, particularly in the end stages of kidney disease. We used BMI to capture obesity in this study but recognize its limitations as a measure of body composition. Secondary outcomes were descriptive and unadjusted due to small sample size and may have been subject to selection bias and confounding. Obesity defined by high BMI is highly prevalent in people with CKD, and patients have health, health care, and social disparity. Future studies to understand the impact of BMI on patients with CKD and how to individualize and manage BMI and obesity across the spectrum of CKD remain important.

Comme principal crit&#xe8;re d&#x2019;int&#xe9;r&#xea;t, nous avons calcul&#xe9; le pourcentage de patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC dans diff&#xe9;rentes cat&#xe9;gories d&#x2019;IMC (&lt;25&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 25-29,9&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> et &#x2265;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>), ainsi que selon leur profil d&#xe9;mographique et clinique. Comme crit&#xe8;res d&#x2019;int&#xe9;r&#xea;ts secondaires, nous avons suivi les patients jusqu&#x2019;au 1<sup>er</sup>&#x2009;janvier&#x2009;2022 afin de r&#xe9;sumer&#x2009;pour chaque cat&#xe9;gorie d&#x2019;IMC&#x2009;: 1) le pourcentage de patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC G3 pr&#xe9;sentant une progression de la maladie r&#xe9;nale (d&#xe9;clin d&#x2019;au moins 50&#x2009;% du DFGe initial); 2) le pourcentage de patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G3-4 pr&#xe9;sentant une insuffisance r&#xe9;nale terminale (initiation de la dialyse d&#x2019;entretien ou DFGe &lt; 15&#x2009;ml/min/1,73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup>); 3) le pourcentage de patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G4-G5D ayant re&#xe7;u une greffe de rein; et 4) les r&#xe9;sultats post-transplantation chez les transplant&#xe9;s pendant la p&#xe9;riode de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude. Nous avons effectu&#xe9; des analyses similaires pour toutes les cat&#xe9;gories de risque d&#x2019;IRC. Sur les 198&#x2009;151&#x2009;patients inclus &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude, le pourcentage d&#x2019;ob&#xe9;sit&#xe9; (IMC &#x2265; 30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) a augment&#xe9; de l&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G1 &#xe0; l&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G4 (37&#x2009;% des patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G1 avaient un IMC &#x2265;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> c. 40&#x2009;% pour l&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G4). La pr&#xe9;valence d&#x2019;un IMC &#xe9;lev&#xe9; a sembl&#xe9; diminuer dans les groupes IRC&#x2009;G5D et IRC T (environ 38&#x2009;% seulement des patients avaient un IMC &#x2265;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> dans l&#x2019;ensemble des groupes). Dans toutes les cat&#xe9;gories d&#x2019;IRC, les personnes avec un IMC &#x2265;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> semblaient pr&#xe9;senter davantage de comorbidit&#xe9;s, utiliser plus de ressources de sant&#xe9; et pr&#xe9;senter davantage de disparit&#xe9;s socio&#xe9;conomiques que celles ayant un IMC plus faible.Bien que les crit&#xe8;res de jugement secondaires &#xe9;taient limit&#xe9;s, nous avons constat&#xe9; que les patients ob&#xe8;ses atteints d&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G3-G4 semblaient pr&#xe9;senter un risque plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9; de progression de l&#x2019;IRC, et que les patients ob&#xe8;ses atteints d&#x2019;IRC&#x2009;G5D &#xe9;taient moins susceptibles de recevoir une greffe au cours de la p&#xe9;riode de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude. Il est int&#xe9;ressant de noter que les transplant&#xe9;s avec un IMC &#x2265;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> ont sembl&#xe9; avoir moins de complications post-transplantation. Nous avons &#xe9;galement observ&#xe9; un &#xab;&#x2009;paradoxe d&#x2019;ob&#xe9;sit&#xe9;&#x2009;&#xbb; par rapport au risque de mortalit&#xe9;, o&#xf9; un IMC &#xe9;lev&#xe9; a sembl&#xe9; avoir un effet protecteur, en particulier dans les stades terminaux de l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale. Nous avons utilis&#xe9; l&#x2019;IMC pour d&#xe9;finir l&#x2019;ob&#xe9;sit&#xe9; dans cette &#xe9;tude, mais nous avons reconnu ses limites en tant que mesure de la composition corporelle. Les r&#xe9;sultats secondaires sont descriptifs et non ajust&#xe9;s en raison de la petite taille de l&#x2019;&#xe9;chantillon; ils pourraient ainsi &#xea;tre sujets &#xe0; un biais de s&#xe9;lection et une source de confusion. L&#x2019;ob&#xe9;sit&#xe9; d&#xe9;finie par un IMC &#xe9;lev&#xe9; est tr&#xe8;s r&#xe9;pandue chez les personnes atteintes d&#x2019;IRC, et il existe des disparit&#xe9;s sociales, de soins et d&#x2019;&#xe9;tat de sant&#xe9; entre les patients. D&#x2019;autres &#xe9;tudes sont n&#xe9;cessaires afin de mieux comprendre l&#x2019;impact de l&#x2019;IMC chez les patients atteints d&#x2019;IRC, et de guider l&#x2019;individualisation des soins et la gestion de l&#x2019;IMC et de l&#x2019;ob&#xe9;sit&#xe9; dans l&#x2019;ensemble du spectre de l&#x2019;IRC.",

      "abstract": "Patients on hemodialysis using a central venous catheter (CVC) are often advised not to shower due to infection risk. This study assessed practices and attitudes of patients and health care providers about showering with CVCs. Survey study. Online survey administered to members of the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN, n=972) and 2 international professional societies (convenience sample). Pen and paper survey administered to patients on maintenance hemodialysis with CVCs able to comprehend English from 2 hemodialysis programs in Ontario, Canada, that advise patients not to shower (St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton [SJHH], n=119, and University Health Network, Toronto [number of patients asked to complete surveys unavailable]). Descriptive statistics. The survey had 304 health care provider respondents (CSN response rate 26%). The most common recommendations were strongly against or against showering (45%). Catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) was ranked as the most important outcome (60%). Most respondents (53%) thought that a well-conducted prospective cohort study demonstrating improvement in a patient-reported outcome with no obvious increase in CRB would reduce the frequency of advice to avoid showering. The survey had 89 patient respondents (SJHH response rate 45%); 69% were currently showering, and 74% reported \"strongly agree\" or \"agree\" to the statement \"I want to shower.\" Prevention of infection was most important to patients in terms of catheter care (78%), and 36% of patients would be willing to participate in a shower study. Low response rate, response rate unavailable from Toronto dialysis units, and exclusion of non-English-speaking patients. The variability in personal hygiene recommendations to patients with CVCs highlights the need for high-quality evidence in this area. A rigorous prospective study examining patient-reported outcomes and CVC-related infections is needed before recommending to patients with a CVC that showering is safe. Patients receiving hemodialysis with a central venous&#xa0;catheter (CVC) as their dialysis access are often told not to shower. We surveyed dialysis health care providers and patients to better understand practices and preferences with regards to personal hygiene and CVC-related care. We found that many patients would like to shower and not being able to shower negatively impacts their daily lives. We also found that health care providers would like to allow patients to shower but are worried about infection risk. Patients are also worried about infection risk. Recommendations made to patients on showering were varied. The ability to safely shower is important to patients. Further study of the risks and benefits of showering among patients receiving hemodialysis through a CVC is needed.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients with kidney failure rely on hemodialysis central venous catheters (CVCs) for their life-sustaining dialysis treatments. CVC dysfunction necessitates removal of up to 20% of CVCs and is an important problem for patients with kidney failure. Thrombosis and fibrin sheath formation are the most common mechanisms of CVC dysfunction beyond the first week after insertion. Factors such as female sex, left-sided CVC placement, and prior CVC dysfunction are associated with a higher risk of dysfunction. Patient-specific factors contribute substantially to variation in the number of CVC dysfunction events. Weekly thrombolytic locks have been shown to improve CVC blood flow rates, prevent infection, and reduce dysfunction requiring removal. However, routine administration may not be cost-effective in hemodialysis units with low infection rates, and targeted use among patients with established CVC dysfunction has not been studied. Concentrated heparin lock ( e.g ., 5000 versus 1000 international unit/ml) has been associated with lower requirements for therapeutic CVC thrombolysis but greater systemic bleeding risks and costs. Citrate 4% was noninferior to standard heparin locks to prevent thrombosis, may cause less bleeding, and is less costly in some countries. Tunneled CVCs with a symmetrical tip have been associated with a lower risk of CVC dysfunction compared with those with a step tip. Multifaceted CVC care interventions can reduce the incidence of dysfunctional CVCs by 33% compared with usual care. Future research to identify patients at high risk of CVC dysfunction will inform individualized vascular access plans, targeted use of preventive strategies, and enrollment criteria for future clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Genetic kidney disease (GKD) accounts for 10% to 20% of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Genetic testing using gene panel or targeted exome sequencing (ES) can confirm GKD; however, integration into clinical practice has been hampered by small studies, selective populations, and data predominately derived from research settings. Using prespecified clinical referral criteria and a diagnostic pipeline, we performed a prospective cohort study describing diagnostic efficacy and clinical utility of genetic assessment in patients with CKD. We analyzed a prospective cohort of 300 participants (256 families) referred to a kidney genetics clinic, between March 2020 and March 2024. Testing strategies included gene panels, and if negative or unsuitable, targeted ES analysis. Testing was performed for the detection of variants in genes known to cause CKD. We identified a causative variant in 33% of families (85/256). Diagnostic yield increased from 23% (<i>n</i>&#xa0;= 70/300) from gene panel alone, to 34% (<i>n</i>&#xa0;= 103/300) with comprehensive testing. The median time from first diagnosis of CKD to genetic assessment was long at 10.4 years. Following genetic assessment, the median time to receive a positive genetic result was 2.9 months. Multiple levels of clinical utility were recorded in patients receiving a genetic diagnosis, varying across CKD subtype. Instituting referral guidelines and a standardized testing algorithm established a genetic diagnosis in one-third of participants, providing insight into the viability of integrating genetic assessment in the CKD diagnostic pathway. Considering the potential for clinical utility, strategies to reduce the time from CKD diagnosis to genetics assessment are needed.",

      "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors are recommended treatment for adults with CKD, but uncertainty exists regarding their use in patients with frailty and/or multimorbidity, among whom polypharmacy is common. We derived a multivariable logistic regression model to predict hospitalization (reflecting frailty) and assessed empagliflozin's risk&#x2013;benefit profile in a post hoc analysis of the double-blind, placebo-controlled EMPA-KIDNEY trial. The EMPA-KIDNEY trial randomized 6609 patients with CKD (eGFR &#x2265;20 to &lt;45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or &#x2265;45 to &lt;90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio &#x2265;200 mg/g) to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or matching placebo and followed them for 2 years (median). Additional characteristics analyzed in subgroups were multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and health-related quality of life at baseline. Cox regression analyses were performed with subgroups defined by approximate thirds of each variable. The strongest predictors of hospitalization were N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, poor mobility, and diabetes and then eGFR and other comorbidities. Empagliflozin was generally well tolerated independent of predicted risk of hospitalization. In relative terms, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary outcome of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.82) and all-cause hospitalization by 14% (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.95), with broadly consistent effects across subgroups of predicted risk of hospitalization, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, or health-related quality of life. In absolute terms, the estimated benefits of empagliflozin were greater in those at highest predicted risk of hospitalization (reflecting frailty) and outweighed potential serious harms. These findings support the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in CKD, irrespective of frailty, multimorbidity, or polypharmacy.",

There was no significant difference in the CHIP&#x2013;cardiovascular disease association based on baseline eGFR, diabetes status, or race. The protective effect of <i>IL6R</i> p.Asp358Ala on non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP cardiovascular risk was similar to the general population. Patients with CKD are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been associated with cardiovascular disease in the general population, with a causal role observed in animal models. In the general population, the effect of CHIP is greater for somatic mutations in predefined CHIP driver genes other than <i>DNMT3A</i> (referred to as non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP). We sought to assess the prospective association between CHIP and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD. CHIP was measured by high-depth targeted sequencing. The primary analysis tested the association of somatic mutations in non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP driver genes with a composite cardiovascular disease end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease in 5043 patients with CKD in four prospective cohorts. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of CHIP subtypes, race, baseline comorbidities, <i>APOL1</i> risk alleles, and <i>IL6R</i> p.Asp358Ala genotype. At baseline, patients had a mean age of 66&#xb1;12 years and eGFR of 43&#xb1;18 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. CHIP was present in 24% of patients, with 13% of all patients carrying acquired non-<i>DNMT3A</i> mutations. Non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP was associated with a 36% higher risk of the composite cardiovascular end point (95% confidence interval [CI], 6% to 76%). Among composite components, non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP was associated with a higher risk of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.10 to 2.47). Baseline eGFR, diabetes status, or race did not alter the association of non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP with cardiovascular risk. Those without genetically reduced IL-6 signaling (noncarriers of <i>IL6R</i> p.Asp358Ala) had worse disease (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.83; <i>P</i><sub><i>subgroup difference</i></sub> = 0.05). In patients with CKD, non-<i>DNMT3A</i> CHIP was associated with cardiovascular disease with an effect size similar to that reported in the general population.",
      "laySummary": "This study found that people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have a specific type of clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) – a condition where blood cells develop mutations – have a significantly higher risk of heart problems like stroke and heart failure. This risk is similar to what's seen in the general population, even after considering factors like kidney function and diabetes. Understanding this connection could lead to better strategies for preventing cardiovascular disease in people with CKD."

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Genetic causes of chronic diseases, once considered rare in adult-onset disease, now account for between 10 and 20% of cases of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Confirming a genetic diagnosis can influence disease management; however, the utility of genetic testing in older adults remains poorly understood, partly due to age-based restrictions on testing access. To better evaluate the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of genetic testing in this population, we analyzed data from adults aged &#x2265;50 years with CKD who were assessed in a specialized kidney genetics clinic. <b>Methods:</b> We studied a cohort of 125 adults with CKD aged &#x2265;50 years at the time of genetic testing. Genetic testing included gene panels targeting disease-related genes based on clinical phenotype, and/or exome sequencing for additional monogenic causes if the initial panel testing was inconclusive. <b>Results:</b> Pathogenic variants in disease-related genes were identified in 38% of patients. The highest diagnostic yield (48%) was in patients aged 50-54 years. The most common diagnosis post-testing was glomerulopathies (32%). Clinical utility, shown through the case series, included modifications to treatment and clinical management, as well as a reduction in the diagnostic odyssey. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings from a dedicated Kidney Genetics Clinic show that genetic testing in adults &#x2265;50 years with CKD has significant diagnostic and clinical utility. These results support guideline recommendations that there should be no upper age limit for genetic testing. Future research in unselected CKD populations is needed to establish the broader applicability and feasibility of genetic testing in older adults.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at whether genetic testing is helpful for adults over 50 with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Researchers found that genetic testing identified a disease cause in nearly 40% of patients, with the highest rate in those aged 50-54.  This information allowed doctors to adjust treatment plans and helped patients avoid a long and confusing process of trying to figure out the cause of their kidney disease, suggesting genetic testing is valuable even in older adults."

      "abstract": "The timely distribution of discharge summaries within 48 hours can play an important role in ensuring safe patient care transitions and reducing readmission. Like other academic centres, we struggled with achieving a regulator mandated outcome of discharge summary authentication within 48 hours. To increase the percentage of discharge summaries authenticated within 48 hours from a baseline of 62% to 75% over 1 year on six acute medicine teams. The model for improvement guided this quality improvement (QI) initiative. Outcome measures included the percentage of discharge summaries authenticated within 48 hours, and the average time from discharge to authentication. Balancing measures were a high-level process measure related to quality; editing behaviours before authentication. Data were analysed using a pre-post design and represented via statistical process control charts, P chart and XbarS charts. While the primary aim was achieved, it was not sustained. By contrast, the time to authentication decreased from 53 hours to 38 hours and was sustained. The percentage of editing of summaries also exhibited significant variability. The 38% who demonstrated considerable improvement in time to authentication had decreased rates of consultant and trainee editing. In contrast, those who edited before authentication took longer to authenticate with a median difference of 5&#x2009;hours (p&lt;2.2e-16) and were less likely to meet the 48-hour target (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.6028, 0.7521). Our findings are important for both regulators and QI practitioners and highlight the importance of defining clinically meaningful targets while also considering their impact on quality and education. While we cannot be certain that summary quality was compromised in those without editing, the association between time to authentication and editing behaviour is highly suggestive. Moreover, it was also associated with a decrease in trainee editing, which is concerning from an educational perspective.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity is increasing in both the general and kidney failure populations. Severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] &#x2265; 40&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is considered by many centers to be a barrier to kidney transplantation (KT). Obesity is typically defined using BMI. Body surface area (BSA) is not considered, though may also be important. We examined post-KT adverse outcomes associated with obesity defined using combined BMI-BSA parameters in a cohort of adult KT recipients (living/deceased donor) across the United States (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients: 2000-2017). Recipient obesity was defined as BMI &#x2265;30&#x2009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, or BSA &#x2265;1.94 m<sup>2</sup> in women and &#x2265;2.17 m<sup>2</sup> in men. We used multivariable cox proportional hazards or logistic regression models as appropriate to assess the association between BMI-BSA-defined obesity with death-censored graft loss, all-cause graft loss, and delayed graft function. The final study included 242 432 patients; 77 556 (32.0%) had obesity based on BMI and 67 312 (28.6%) had obesity based on BSA. Compared to patients with a nonobese BMI and BSA, the adjusted risk of death-censored graft loss, all-cause graft loss, and delayed graft function was greatest when both BMI and BSA indicated obesity (adjusted hazard ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-1.27, adjusted hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI: 1.07-1.11, adjusted odds ratio 1.58, 95% CI: 1.53-1.63, respectively); a significantly greater risk than when BMI and BSA were discordant. Currently only BMI is considered when evaluating obesity-related KT risk; however, combined BMI-BSA obesity may better identify individuals at high risk of poor outcomes posttransplant than BMI alone.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how obesity affects kidney transplant success, considering both body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA). Researchers found that patients considered obese by *both* BMI and BSA had a higher risk of their new kidney failing or experiencing other complications after the transplant compared to those obese by only one measure. This suggests that using both BMI and BSA to define obesity could help doctors better identify and manage patients at higher risk after a kidney transplant."

      "abstract": "Obesity is associated with morbidity and mortality in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Identifying safe and effective nonpharmacologic and nonsurgical interventions to achieve a healthier body weight is essential. Scoping review of observational studies and randomized control trials. Adults aged&#xa0;&#x2265;18 years with a body mass index (BMI) &#x2265;30&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and advanced CKD (category G3-G5D). Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we systematically searched 2 electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) for studies that examined the effect of nonpharmacologic and nonsurgical interventions for weight loss between January 2010-July 2024. Outcomes included weight loss and BMI. We also examined adherence, whether participants were involved in the design of the study, and adverse events. Two reviewers screened relevant citations and extracted study characteristics and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Study data were summarized descriptively following guidance from the PRISMA-ScR. Of the 2,453 citations, 17 met inclusion criteria (9 randomized controlled trials, 2 nonrandomized trials, 5 prospective cohort studies, and 1 retrospective cohort study) and included a total of 960 participants. Interventions included exercise programs, dietary therapy, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy with follow-up ranging from 3-12 months. It appeared that dietary intervention that promoted significant caloric restriction over the short term led to the most weight loss (average, 7&#xa0;kg). Interventions with monitored coaching appeared helpful. No adverse events were reported. None of the studies involved participants as partners. Not all studies included participants' estimated glomerular filtration rate or BMI category, and we may have included some without severe CKD or BMI&#xa0;&#x2265;30&#xa0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Programs encouraging very low-energy diets along with monitored coaching, may result in modest short-term weight loss. Patient views on these programs and their longer term success remain unclear.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused considerable disruption to health care services. Limited data exist on its impacts on clinical outcomes and health care utilization in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). To compare the rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, kidney-related outcomes, and health care utilization in patients with advanced CKD before and during the first 21 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Population-based, repeated cross-sectional study from March 15, 2017 to November 15, 2021, with follow-up until December 14, 2021 (preceding the Omicron variant). Linked administrative health care databases from Ontario, Canada. Adult patients with advanced CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (excluding patients receiving maintenance dialysis). The pre-COVID-19 period was from March 15, 2017 to March 14, 2020 and the COVID-19 period was from March 15, 2020 to December 14, 2021. Poisson generalized estimating equations were used to predict post-COVID-19 patient outcomes and health utilization based on pre-COVID trends, estimating relative changes between the observed and expected outcomes. The multivariable model incorporated age group-sex interaction terms, a continuous variable denoting time in months to capture general trends, and pre-COVID month indicators to adjust for seasonal changes. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause hospitalizations, non-COVID-19-related deaths and hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, mechanical ventilation, and emergency room visits. We also examined cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, kidney-related outcomes, and ambulatory visits. We included 101 688 adults with advanced CKD. The incidence of all-cause mortality was 147.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 145.1, 149.7) per 1000 person-years in the pre-COVID-19 period compared to 150.8 (95% CI = 147.9, 153.7) per 1000 person-years in the COVID-19 period. After adjustment, there was an 8% higher rate of all-cause mortality during the COVID-19 (adjusted relative rate [aRR] = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.12). Non-COVID-19-related deaths did not increase substantially (aRR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97, 1.07). The COVID-19 period was associated with a lower rate of all-cause hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and emergency room visits. There were declines in long-term care admissions and non-nephrology physician visits in the first 3 months of the pandemic. In contrast, nephrology visits remained stable throughout the study period, including the first 3 months of the pandemic. Similarly, the monthly rates of acute kidney injury requiring dialysis initiation showed little variation compared with pre-pandemic levels. Due to data availability at the time of analysis, we did not examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with advanced CKD beyond December 2021. Non-COVID-19-related deaths did not increase during the first 21 months of the pandemic, despite reduced health care utilization. The study informs health service planning in future health care emergencies.",

      "abstract": "Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) slow progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but there is no randomised evidence of their effects on health-related quality of life (QoL) and healthcare use. We explored the effects of empagliflozin on health-related QoL, healthcare use and UK healthcare costs in the EMPA-KIDNEY trial. EMPA-KIDNEY, a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, was conducted at 241 centres in eight countries (Canada, China, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, the UK, and the USA), and included participants aged 18 years or older with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, or with an eGFR of 45 to &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) of &#x2265;200 mg/g at screening. They were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily or matching placebo. We estimated the effect of empagliflozin (UK&#xa3;1.31/day) on exploratory outcomes (unless otherwise specified) of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), UK costs (2023 UK&#xa3;) of hospital admissions (a prespecified secondary outcome), concomitant medications and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; a prespecified tertiary outcome) management over 2 years on study treatment (median active-trial follow-up) and on ESKD costs over 2 further years off study treatment (median post-trial follow-up) using shared parameter models analysing outcomes together with time to death or negative binomial models. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03594110. Between May 15, 2019 and April 16, 2021, 6609 participants were randomly assigned to empagliflozin (3304 participants) or matching placebo (3305 participants) in the active-trial which lasted for a median of 2.0 years. Among them, 4891 (74%) were enrolled in the post-trial follow-up. Per participant allocated to empagliflozin over 2 years, total empagliflozin cost was &#xa3;826 (95% confidence interval: 818 to 835), QALYs were 0.012 higher (0.001 to 0.022), with less cost for hospital admission (-&#xa3;239, -449 to -29), concomitant medications (-&#xa3;130, -214 to -47), and management of ESKD (-&#xa3;208, -414 to -2) compared to placebo. Over a further 2 years of post-trial follow-up off study treatment, there were additional per participant ESKD cost savings (-&#xa3;842, -1441 to -242), resulting in net total healthcare cost of -&#xa3;593 (-1384 to 198) over 4 years. The probability of 2 years of empagliflozin treatment being cost-effective at &#xa3;20 K threshold in the UK was 43% over 2 years of follow-up and 91% over 4 years. The relative effects of empagliflozin on each cost component were similar across categories by baseline levels of eGFR, uACR and diabetes status, with larger reductions in healthcare costs estimated in categories at higher risk of CKD progression. In EMPA-KIDNEY, 2 years treatment with empagliflozin improved QALYs, and reduced use and cost of other healthcare, resulting in high likelihood of cost-effectiveness across a broad range of patients with CKD. The study's key limitation is its relatively short active treatment period and follow-up duration, which may lead to underestimation of the cost-effectiveness of long-term SGLT2i treatment in CKD.

      "abstract": "Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition, with guidelines recommending urgent treatment when the serum potassium level is greater than 6.0 mmol/L. However, these recommendations are inconsistent, leading to diverse approaches to patient care. The primary objectives were to use population-based datasets to determine how often outpatient hyperkalemia (K &gt; 6.2 mmol/L) occurs and how frequently patients present to the emergency department (ED) within 24 hours of the hyperkalemia report. Secondary objectives were to compare the characteristics of patients who had an ED encounter to those who did not, assess clinical outcomes within 7 days of the hyperkalemia report, and describe the initial potassium result within 24 hours of an ED encounter. Retrospective cohort study using linked population-based datasets at ICES. Ontario, Canada from January 1, 2007, to December 24, 2021. Adult patients (&#x2265;18 years) not on dialysis with an outpatient hyperkalemia result &gt;6.2 mmol/L who were identified through flagged and urgently communicated results from outpatient laboratories. Emergency department encounters within 24 hours following an outpatient serum potassium report &gt;6.2 mmol/L. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest in the ED, hospitalizations, and new dialysis starts within 7 days of the hyperkalemia report. Administrative healthcare data were linked with laboratory results to compare baseline characteristics, medication use, healthcare utilization, and clinical outcomes for all patients. Standardized differences were used for comparisons. There were over 65 million serum potassium measurements and 57&#x2009;607 individuals with an outpatient hyperkalemia value &gt;6.2 mmol/L. Of these, 7469 (13.0%) individuals had an ED encounter within 24 hours. Individuals with an ED encounter had more comorbidities, higher medication use, and more prior healthcare utilization. Within 7 days of the hyperkalemia report, 675 of the 57&#x2009;607 individuals (1.2%) had died. Where data were available, the first potassium value within 24 hours of an ED encounter was 1.5 mmol/L (&#xb1; SD 1.3) lower, on average, than the initial outpatient potassium value. All-cause mortality may not be attributable to the hyperkalemia result. Sudden cardiac death, which is more specific to hyperkalemia, is not completely captured in our data sources. Data for medications are limited to patients 65 years of age and older. Outpatient hyperkalemia is common. Despite guidelines recommending urgent treatment for patients with serum potassium levels &gt;6.2 mmol/L, most are not referred to the ED.

Les lignes directrices recommandant un traitement urgent lorsque le taux de potassium s&#xe9;rique est sup&#xe9;rieur &#xe0; 6,0 mmol/l. Ces recommandations ne sont toutefois pas appliqu&#xe9;es de fa&#xe7;on uniforme, ce qui se traduit par des approches diverses pour les soins aux patients. L&#x2019;objectif principal &#xe9;tait d&#x2019;utiliser des ensembles de donn&#xe9;es populationnelles pour d&#xe9;terminer la fr&#xe9;quence de l&#x2019;hyperkali&#xe9;mie (K &gt; 6,2 mmol/l) mesur&#xe9;e en consultation externe et la fr&#xe9;quence des visites aux urgences dans les 24 heures suivant un rapport d&#x2019;hyperkali&#xe9;mie.

Les diff&#xe9;rences normalis&#xe9;es ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; utilis&#xe9;es pour les comparaisons. Plus de 65 millions de mesures de potassium s&#xe9;rique ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; r&#xe9;pertori&#xe9;es. En tout, 57&#x2009;607 individus avaient eu un rapport d&#x2019;hyperkali&#xe9;mie (K &gt; 6,2 mmol/l) en consultation externe. De ce nombre, 7469 (13,0 %) personnes avaient visit&#xe9; les urgences dans les 24 heures, et ces personnes avaient davantage de comorbidit&#xe9;s, prenaient plus de m&#xe9;dicaments et avaient plus souvent utilis&#xe9; les soins de sant&#xe9;. Des 57&#x2009;607 personnes identifi&#xe9;es, 675 (1,2 %) &#xe9;taient d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9;es dans les 7 jours suivant le rapport d&#x2019;hyperkali&#xe9;mie.

For patients with advanced CKD (CKD G4-5D), kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment to improve morbidity and quality of life. However, obesity is a barrier to transplantation, due to an associated risk of postoperative complications and decreased graft survival. We sought to understand patient experiences with weight management and CKD to inform future studies in this area. Descriptive qualitative study. London, Ontario, Canada. Individuals with CKD G4-5D and experiences with obesity and weight management. We interviewed 12 participants with CKD G4-5ND, using thematic analysis and a phenomenological framework. We explored their beliefs, experiences, and expectations of weight loss management. An inductive, open coding technique was used to generate themes that informed our understanding of their shared experiences. We identified 6 themes from our data: strengths and gaps in healthcare support, influence of social circles and systems, past experiences with weight loss, limitations of current health status, knowledge and motivation around weight management, and personal autonomy in treatment choices. Small homogenous population limits generalizability, self-report of weight loss attempts without numerical data. Our study emphasizes opportunities for healthcare providers to identify and address potential unmet needs in weight management, while also guiding patient-centered conversations on this topic.

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients receiving hemodialysis, yet effective preventive therapies remain limited. Supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), may have cardiovascular benefits in the general population, but efficacy among patients receiving hemodialysis is uncertain. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 26 sites in Canada and Australia, we assigned adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis to daily supplementation with fish oil (4 g of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [1.6 g of EPA and 0.8 g of DHA]) or corn-oil placebo. The primary end point was a composite of all serious cardiovascular events including sudden and nonsudden cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included extension of the primary end point to include noncardiac causes of death, the individual components of the primary end point, and a first cardiovascular event or death from any cause. Between November 28, 2013, and July 22, 2019, a total of 1228 participants underwent randomization; 610 were assigned to the fish-oil group and 618 to the placebo group. During 3.5 years of follow-up, the rate of serious cardiovascular events was significantly lower in the fish-oil group than in the placebo group (0.31 vs. 0.61 per 1000 patient-days; hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.70; P&lt;0.001). The rate of the extended primary end point that included noncardiac causes of death appeared to be lower in the fish-oil group than in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.90). The hazard ratio for cardiac death was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.75); for fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.56 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.80); for peripheral vascular disease leading to amputation, 0.57 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.86); for fatal and nonfatal stroke, 0.37 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.76); and for a first cardiovascular event or death from any cause, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.87). Adherence to the trial regimen and the incidence of adverse events did not differ meaningfully between the groups. The rate of serious cardiovascular events among participants receiving maintenance hemodialysis was lower with daily supplementation with n-3 fatty acids than with placebo. (Supported by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada and others; PISCES ClinicalTrials.gov number, ISRCTN00691795.).",
      "laySummary": "This study found that daily fish oil supplementation significantly reduced serious cardiovascular events in people receiving hemodialysis, a common treatment for kidney failure.  Over three years, those taking fish oil had fewer heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular problems compared to those taking a placebo. This suggests that fish oil could be a helpful way to improve heart health in this vulnerable population."

      "abstract": "Hemodialysis (HD) results in reduced brain blood flow, and HD-related circulatory stress and regional ischemia are associated with brain injury over time. However, studies to date have not provided definitive direct evidence of acute brain injury during a HD treatment session. Using intradialytic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy to examine HD-associated changes in brain structure and neurochemistry, the authors found that multiple white (WM) tracts had diffusion imaging changes characteristic of cytotoxic edema, a consequence of ischemic insult and a precursor to fixed structural WM injury. Spectroscopy showed decreases in prefrontal N -acetyl aspartate (NAA) and choline concentrations consistent with energy deficit and perfusion anomaly. This suggests that one HD session can cause brain injury and that studies of interventions that mitigate this treatment's effects on the brain are warranted. Hemodialysis (HD) treatment-related hemodynamic stress results in recurrent ischemic injury to organs such as the heart and brain. Short-term reduction in brain blood flow and long-term white matter changes have been reported, but the basis of HD-induced brain injury is neither well-recognized nor understood, although progressive cognitive impairment is common. We used neurocognitive assessments, intradialytic anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to examine the nature of acute HD-associated brain injury and associated changes in brain structure and neurochemistry relevant to ischemia. Data acquired before HD and during the last 60 minutes of HD (during maximal circulatory stress) were analyzed to assess the acute effects of HD on the brain. We studied 17 patients (mean age 63&#xb1;13 years; 58.8% were male, 76.5% were White, 17.6% were Black, and 5.9% were of Indigenous ethnicity). We found intradialytic changes, including the development of multiple regions of white matter exhibiting increased fractional anisotropy with associated decreases in mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity-characteristic features of cytotoxic edema (with increase in global brain volumes). We also observed decreases in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy-measured N -acetyl aspartate and choline concentrations during HD, indicative of regional ischemia. This study demonstrates for the first time that significant intradialytic changes in brain tissue volume, diffusion metrics, and brain metabolite concentrations consistent with ischemic injury occur in a single dialysis session. These findings raise the possibility that HD might have long-term neurological consequences. Further study is needed to establish an association between intradialytic magnetic resonance imaging findings of brain injury and cognitive impairment and to understand the chronic effects of HD-induced brain injury.

      "abstract": "The life-sustaining treatment of hemodialysis (HD) induces recurrent and cumulative systemic circulatory stress resulting in cardiovascular injury. These recurrent insults compound preexisting cardiovascular sequalae leading to the development of myocardial injury and resulting in extremely high morbidity/mortality. This is largely a consequence of challenged microcirculatory flow within the myocardium (evidenced by detailed imaging-based studies). Currently, monitoring during HD is performed at the macrovascular level. Non-invasive monitoring of organ perfusion would allow the detection and therapeutic amelioration of this pathophysiological response to HD. Non-invasive percutaneous perfusion monitoring of the skin (using photoplethysmography-PPG) has been shown to be predictive of HD-induced myocardial stunning (a consequence of segmental ischemia). In this study, we extended these observations to include a dynamic assessment of skin perfusion during HD compared with directly measured myocardial perfusion during dialysis and cardiac contractile function. We evaluated the intradialytic microcirculatory response in 12 patients receiving conventional HD treatments using continuous percutaneous perfusion monitoring throughout HD. Cardiac echocardiography was performed prior to the initiation of HD, and again at peak-HD stress, to assess the development of regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs). Myocardial perfusion imaging was obtained at the same timepoints (pre-HD and peak-HD stress), utilizing intravenous administered contrast and a computerized tomography (CT)-based method. Intradialytic changes in pulse strength (derived from PPG) were compared with the development of HD-induced RWMAs (indicative of myocardial stunning) and changes in myocardial perfusion. We found an association between the lowest pulse strength reduction (PPG) and the development of RWMAs (<i>p</i> = 0.03) and also with changes in global myocardial perfusion (CT) (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Ultrafiltration rate (mL/kg/hour) was a significant driver of HD-induced circulatory stress [(associated with the greatest pulse strength reduction (<i>p</i> = 0.01), a reduction in global myocardial perfusion (<i>p</i> = 0.001), and the development of RWMAs (<i>p</i> = 0.03)]. Percutaneous perfusion monitoring using PPG is a useful method of assessing intradialytic hemodynamic stability and HD-induced circulatory stress. The information generated at the microcirculatory level of the skin is reflective of direct measures of myocardial perfusion and the development of HD-induced myocardial stunning. This approach for the detection and management of HD-induced cardiac injury warrants additional evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Acute and chronic kidney disease continues to confer significant morbidity and mortality in the clinical setting. Despite high prevalence of these conditions, few validated biomarkers exist to predict kidney dysfunction. In this study, we utilized a novel kidney multiplex panel to measure 21 proteins in plasma and urine to characterize the spectrum of biomarker profiles in kidney disease. Blood and urine samples were obtained from age-/sex-matched healthy control subjects (HC), critically-ill COVID-19 patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), and patients with chronic or end-stage kidney disease (CKD/ESKD). Biomarkers were measured with a kidney multiplex panel, and results analyzed with conventional statistics and machine learning. Correlations were examined between biomarkers and patient clinical and laboratory variables. Median AKI subject age was 65.5 (IQR 58.5-73.0) and median CKD/ESKD age was 65.0 (IQR 50.0-71.5). Of the CKD/ESKD patients, 76.1% were on hemodialysis, 14.3% of patients had kidney transplant, and 9.5% had CKD without kidney replacement therapy. In plasma, 19 proteins were significantly different in titer between the HC versus AKI versus CKD/ESKD groups, while NAG and RBP4 were unchanged. TIMP-1 (PPV 1.0, NPV 1.0), best distinguished AKI from HC, and TFF3 (PPV 0.99, NPV 0.89) best distinguished CKD/ESKD from HC. In urine, 18 proteins were significantly different between groups except Calbindin, Osteopontin and TIMP-1. Osteoactivin (PPV 0.95, NPV 0.95) best distinguished AKI from HC, and &#x3b2;2-microglobulin (PPV 0.96, NPV 0.78) best distinguished CKD/ESKD from HC. A variety of correlations were noted between patient variables and either plasma or urine biomarkers. Using a novel kidney multiplex biomarker panel, together with conventional statistics and machine learning, we identified unique biomarker profiles in the plasma and urine of patients with AKI and CKD/ESKD. We demonstrated correlations between biomarker profiles and patient clinical variables. Our exploratory study provides biomarker data for future hypothesis driven research on kidney disease.",

      "abstract": "Individuals receiving hemodialysis have high rates of cardiovascular disease not explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Intradialytic exercise improves cardiovascular outcomes, including arterial resistance, BP, and heart rate variability. Clinicians should consider including intradialytic aerobic exercise programs in hemodialysis care to supplement broader treatment plans. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among people with kidney failure on hemodialysis, for whom improving cardiovascular health is a research priority. Intradialytic myocardial stunning is common and associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Intradialytic exercise may mitigate intradialytic myocardial stunning and improve cardiovascular structure and function. This systematic review investigated the effect of intradialytic exercise on cardiovascular outcomes in adults undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (PROSPERO CRD42018103118). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, SportDiscus, and PEDro databases from 1960 until June 2022, for randomized and nonrandomized studies investigating the effect of intradialytic exercise programs on objective cardiovascular outcomes, prespecified as primary or secondary outcomes. The primary outcome was arterial resistance. Of 10,837 references identified, 32 met eligibility criteria. These studies investigated the effect of intradialytic exercise on arterial resistance (eight studies), BP (20 studies), myocardial structure and function (seven studies), endothelial function (two studies), sympathetic overactivity (nine studies), biomarkers of cardiac injury (three studies), and cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality (two studies). Most studies used aerobic exercise as the intervention and usual care (no exercise) controls. Meta-analysis of intradialytic exercise versus usual care resulted in a statistically significant reduction in arterial resistance measured by pulse wave velocity with mean difference &#x2212;1.63 m/s (95% confidence interval, &#x2212;2.51 to &#x2212;0.75). Meta-analyses for diastolic BP, left ventricular ejection fraction, and low-frequency/high-frequency ratio measure of heart rate variability also showed statistically significant improvements with exercise. There was no significant difference in change in systolic BP, augmentation index, and left ventricular mass index between groups. Intradialytic exercise programming resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement to pulse wave velocity, a component of arterial resistance. Improvements in several physiologic measures of cardiovascular health, including diastolic BP, left ventricular ejection fraction, and heart rate variability measured by the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio were also observed. The effects of intradialytic exercise on major adverse cardiovascular events remains uncertain.",

      "abstract": "The concept of residual kidney function (RKF) is exclusively based upon urine volume and small solute clearance, making RKF challenging to assess in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to test the technical feasibility of obtaining usable sodium magnetic resonance imaging (23Na-MRI) kidney images in hemodialysis (HD) participants. We conducted an exploratory prospective study to quantify the cortico-medullary sodium gradient in 17 healthy volunteers and 21 HD participants. Participants fasted for 8 h prior to their study visit. Urine samples were collected to measure urinary osmolarity, before MRI. Proton and sodium pictures were merged; regions of interest were delineated for the medulla and cortex when feasible. In cases where cortex could not be identified, we considered the corticomedullary gradient (CMG) to be no longer present, resulting in a medulla-to-cortex ratio of 1. Median (interquartile range) fasting medulla-to-cortex ratio was significantly higher 1.56 (1.5-1.61) in healthy volunteers compared with HD patients 1.22 (1.13-1.3), P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.0001. Medulla to cortex ratio and median urinary osmolarity were correlated (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.87, P&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.0001) in the whole population. We found a significant association between HD vintage and medulla-to-cortex ratio, whereas we did not find any association with urine volume. Sodium signal intensity distribution within healthy kidney describes two different peaks relating to well defined cortex and medulla, whereas HD participants displays only a single peak indicative of the markedly lower sodium concentration. This study is only exploratory, with a modest number of patients. The application of kidney 23Na-MRI to the study of RKF in patients receiving maintenance HD is practical and provides a previously unavailable ability to interrogate the function of remnant tubular function.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05014178.",

      "abstract": "The conventional methods for assessing kidney function, such as glomerular filtration rate and microalbuminuria, provide only partial insight into kidney function. Multi-parametric and multi-nuclear functional resonance magnetic imaging (MRI) techniques are innovative approaches to unraveling kidney physiology. Multi-parametric MRI includes various sequences to evaluate kidney perfusion, tissue oxygenation, and microstructure characterization, including fibrosis-a key pathological event in acute and chronic kidney disease and in transplant patients-without the need for invasive kidney biopsy. Multi-nuclear MRI detects nuclei other than protons. <sup>23</sup>Na MRI enables visualization of the corticomedullary gradient and assessment of tissue sodium storage, which can be particularly relevant for personalized medicine in salt-wasting tubular disorders. Meanwhile, <sup>31</sup>P-MRS measures intracellular phosphate and ATP variations, providing insights into oxidative metabolism in the muscle during exercise and recovery. This technique can be useful for detecting subclinical ischemia in chronic kidney disease and in tubulopathies with kidney phosphate wasting. These techniques are non-invasive and do not involve radiation exposure, making them especially suitable for longitudinal and serial assessments. They enable in vivo evaluation of kidney function on a whole-organ basis within a short acquisition time and with the ability to distinguish between medullary and cortical compartments. Therefore, they offer considerable potential for pediatric patients. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the main imaging techniques, summarize available literature data on both adult and pediatric populations, and examine the perspectives and challenges associated with multi-parametric and multi-nuclear MRI.",

      "abstract": "Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions provide both clearance of uremic toxins and sodium and water. An intraperitoneal (IP) solution of icodextrin and glucose designed without the requirement for uremic toxin clearance could provide substantially greater sodium and water removal than PD solutions. We examined varying concentrations of icodextrin and dextrose IP solutions in rats. We evaluated a 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution in animals and humans. Small and large animal models, and humans (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;10) with kidney failure. 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution. We evaluated ultrafiltration (UF), sodium removal, and peritoneal health in animals. We evaluated safety, tolerability, and efficacy in humans. In rats, increasing concentrations of icodextrin and dextrose IP solutions, up to 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose, produced progressively greater UF (<i>P</i>&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). In sheep treated with 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose, the mean UF was &#x223c;3.5-fold greater (1.77&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.22&#xa0;L vs 0.47&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.34&#xa0;L; <i>P</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.005) and the mean sodium removal was &#x223c;4-fold greater (7.07&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;0.72&#xa0;g vs 1.78&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;1.27&#xa0;g; <i>P</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003) compared with commercially available 7.5% icodextrin PD solution. Long-term exposure of mice (30 days) and sheep (30-45 days) to a 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution resulted in no significant structural tissue changes compared with the control 4.25% commercially available PD solution. In humans, a 24-hour dwell of a 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution resulted in median net UF of 2,498&#xa0;mL (IQR, 2,249-2,768), and median sodium removal of 387&#xa0;mmol (IQR, 372-434&#xa0;mmol). No serious adverse events occurred. The long-term safety with chronic therapy and the efficacy in patients without kidney failure were not established and require future studies. A 30% icodextrin and 10% dextrose IP solution provides more efficient UF and sodium removal than traditional PD solutions.

      "abstract": "The manipulation of dialysate sodium in an animal hemodialysis model has allowed for assessment of endothelial damage. Hemodialysis results in direct acute endothelial injury and microcirculatory disturbance. Hemodialysis-induced effects are aggravated with exposure to high sodium dialysate, potentially resulting in sustained injury to the glycocalyx. Hemodialysis causes injury to the glycocalyx, inducing shedding of syndecan-1. This damage results from hemodynamic stress of hemodialysis and injury caused by oncotic shifts in the presence of additional sodium. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sodium dialysate concentration on endothelial cell injury and microcirculatory dysfunction during hemodialysis. We hypothesize that changes in plasma sodium concentration will result in direct injury to the glycocalyx and reduce microcirculatory perfusion. Twenty-seven healthy male Wistar Kyoto rats underwent hemodialysis: Eight were exposed to 140 mM sodium dialysate concentration (control), ten were exposed to low sodium dialysate (130 mM), and nine were exposed to high sodium dialysate (150 mM). Throughout hemodialysis, intravital microscopy was used to image the microvasculature perfusion at baseline, during extracorporeal circulation with no dialysate flow (sham), at 1 hour into hemodialysis, at 2 hours into hemodialysis, and after hemodialysis (final). Blood samples were collected at the same time points corresponding to the intravital microscopy image acquisitions to measure syndecan-1. The findings demonstrate a gradual increase in syndecan-1 concentration in blood plasma and a consistent trend of lower perfusion throughout the duration of the experiment in all experimental groups. Particularly, syndecan-1 concentration in plasma was significantly higher at 2 hours into hemodialysis in the high sodium dialysate group compared with the control and low sodium dialysate group. Hemodialysis results in direct acute endothelial injury and microcirculatory disturbance. This effect is aggravated by exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of sodium, potentially resulting in sustained injury to the glycocalyx.",
      "laySummary": "This study investigated how the amount of sodium in the fluid used during dialysis affects damage to blood vessel linings and blood flow. Researchers found that using a dialysate with higher sodium levels worsened damage to the protective layer on blood vessels and reduced blood flow during dialysis. This suggests that carefully controlling sodium levels during dialysis is important to minimize harm to the body's delicate circulatory system."

      "abstract": "Current hemodialysis (HD), using conventional high-flux dialyzers, is handicapped by clearance limitations, contributing to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom burden. Recent international consensus guideline-setting efforts have prioritized the identification and management of symptoms and subjective experience, while acknowledging the lack of appropriate tools available to fully appreciate and continuously monitor symptoms. Multicenter interventional trial. Forty-seven patients undergoing established, conventional, thrice weekly HD in 2 centers in Ontario, Canada. Fifteen-month study with the following 5 phases: (1) 1 month observation (high-flux HD), (2) 3 months expanded hemodialysis (HDx); (3) 2 months wash-out (high-flux HD), (4) 6 months HDx, (5) 3 months wash-out (high-flux HD). HRQoL and symptom burden were evaluated using a dynamic patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) tool throughout the study. This study aimed to use a dynamic PROM to interrogate patient experience and confirm HRQoL and symptom benefit of expanded hemodialysis (HDx) using a medium cutoff dialyzer. The durability of the effects of treatment and variability of symptom measures were analyzed, with the aim to further establish causality through withdrawal and reintroduction of therapy. HDx therapy improved HRQoL (19% from baseline) and a variety of symptoms including general wellbeing (23%), energy (33%), sleep quality (33%), pruritus (30%), pain (19%), restless leg syndrome (15%), mood (12%), appetite (9%), breathlessness (9%), and HD recovery (26%). Response was more pronounced in those with poorer HRQoL and higher symptom burden. Improvements were durable over time with less symptom variability. Improvement diminished with return to high-flux HD. Drivers of poor HRQoL were largely general wellbeing, energy, sleep quality, pruritus, and bodily pain. Relatively small cohort (because of pandemic restrictions) and unblinded design (partially overcome with wash-out and reintroduction). Use of a dynamic PROM effectively evaluated HRQoL, symptom burden, and response to treatment in HD patients. Use of HDx therapy improved clinically meaningful outcomes with durable effect and was associated with less variability in important symptom domains than conventional high-flux HD. People undergoing hemodialysis (HD) often experience poor quality of life and extreme symptoms. This study examined whether expanded hemodialysis (HDx)&#x2014;a newer therapy using a specialized filter&#x2014;could improve symptoms and wellbeing. Over 15 months, 47 patients in Ontario, Canada, switched between standard HD and HDx while reporting their symptoms through a dynamic patient-reported outcomes measurement tool. HDx led to improvements in quality of life (19%), energy (33%), sleep (33%), and pain (19%), with effects lasting over time. Patients with more severe symptoms saw the greatest benefit. Symptoms worsened when switching back to standard HD. These findings suggest HDx provides lasting symptom relief with less variability and better quality of life than standard HD.",
      "laySummary": "This study investigated whether a newer type of hemodialysis (HD) called expanded hemodialysis (HDx) could improve patients' quality of life and reduce their symptoms.  Over 15 months, patients who switched to HDx reported significant improvements in areas like energy, sleep, and pain, with these benefits lasting even after returning to standard HD.  The results suggest that HDx may be a better option for some dialysis patients, offering lasting symptom relief and a better overall quality of life."

      "abstract": "Recurrent segmental myocardial ischemia (myocardial stunning) is a well-recognized consequence of hemodialysis leading to fixed contractile deficits and increased morbidity and cardiac mortality. Although epicardial coronary artery disease (CAD) is not a prerequisite, hemodialysis patients commonly have significant arterial plaque burden, and the interaction with established CAD and hemodialysis-induced myocardial ischemic injury is currently unknown. A single-center cross-sectional study. Thirteen patients on maintenance hemodialysis (London, Ontario, and Canada). The presence of significant coronary stenoses as assessed using coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography. Principal aim was to identify changes in myocardial perfusion and stunning as assessed by CT and echocardiography, respectively. We used CT angiography with intradialytic CT perfusion and echocardiography to evaluate perfusion and ventricular contractile response during dialysis in patients with and without CAD. Coronary artery images were acquired before dialysis (baseline). The CT perfusion scans were conducted at baseline, peak-dialysis stress, and 30 minutes after dialysis to quantify global and segmental perfusion of the left ventricular myocardium. At each timepoint, segmental myocardial stunning was identified as intradialytic development of regional wall motion abnormalities using longitudinal strain analysis from 2D echocardiograms. Among 13 participants, 3 were identified with asymptomatic CAD. Among the 10 participants with no identifiable CAD, there was a decrease in global myocardial perfusion from baseline to peak dialysis and a recovery to baseline level after dialysis. In asymptomatic CAD participants, the number of myocardial segments experiencing regional wall motion abnormalities was elevated at peak and after dialysis. No significant intradialytic changes in global myocardial perfusion were observed, but the presence of CAD showed additive effects on segmental perfusion and contractile response to HD. This study was an exploratory study with a small sample size. This study demonstrated hemodialysis-induced circulatory stress, by a reduction in perfusion and development of myocardial stunning in the absence of CAD. Decreased perfusion in the heart muscle is a common consequence of hemodialysis. This often results in reduced contractile function of the heart and is associated with increased morbidity and cardiac-related deaths. Although coronary artery disease is not present in all patients on hemodialysis, many have significant blockage in their arteries, which may worsen the effects of hemodialysis treatment on heart perfusion. We conducted research on 13 hemodialysis participants using multimodal imaging of the heart and confirmed that dialysis-induced reduction in blood flow in the heart muscle that was associated with lower contractility of the heart in patients without coronary artery disease. These effects worsened after the end of the hemodialysis treatment session in patients with coronary artery disease.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how hemodialysis affects the heart in people with and without existing heart artery disease. Researchers found that hemodialysis can reduce blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to temporary weakening of the heart's pumping ability, even in people without heart disease.  Importantly, this effect was worse in those who already had coronary artery disease, suggesting that dialysis and heart artery problems can negatively interact to further harm the heart."

We undertook this study to assess the burden of apoptotic cells in synovial tissue in patients with late-stage knee OA and to investigate whether OA impairs the macrophage-mediated clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis. Synovial tissue was collected from individuals with healthy knees and patients with late-stage knee OA during arthroplasty. Synovial apoptotic cell burden was assessed by immunofluorescence for cleaved caspase 3. Efferocytosis of apoptotic Jurkat cells by CD14+ synovial tissue macrophages and peripheral blood-derived macrophages was quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy. Effects of OA on macrophage-mediated efferocytosis were modeled by stimulating blood-derived macrophages with synovial fluid collected from individuals with healthy knees and patients with early- or late-stage knee OA. Patients with late-stage knee OA had more apoptotic synovial cells compared to healthy individuals. There was a marked reduction in the fraction of synovial tissue macrophages engaging in efferocytosis and the quantity of material efferocytosed by individual macrophages in OA patients. Blood-derived macrophages exposed to synovial fluid from patients with knee OA recapitulated the defective efferocytosis, with the greatest effect from patients with early-stage knee OA and higher disease activity (pain and inflammation). Apoptotic cells accumulate in the synovium of patients with late-stage knee OA. Our results suggest that OA impairs critical homeostatic functions of synovial macrophages, leading to accumulation of apoptotic cells.",

      "abstract": "Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the best treatment option for patients with kidney failure and offers significant medical and economic advantages for both patients and health systems. Despite this, rates of LDKT in Canada have stagnated and vary significantly across Canadian provinces, the reasons for which are not well understood. Our prior work has suggested that system-level factors may be contributing to these differences. Identifying these factors can help inform system-level interventions to increase LDKT. Our objective is to generate a systemic interpretation of LDKT delivery across provincial health systems with variable performance. We aim to identify the attributes and processes that facilitate the delivery of LDKT to patients, and those that create barriers and compare these across systems with variable performance. These objectives are contextualized within our broader goal of increasing rates of LDKT in Canada, particularly in lower-performing provinces. This research takes the form of a qualitative comparative case study analysis of 3 provincial health systems in Canada that have high, moderate, and low rates of LDKT performance (the percentage of LDKT to all kidney transplantations performed). Our approach is underpinned by an understanding of health systems as complex adaptive systems that are multilevel and interconnected, and involve nonlinear interactions between people and organizations, operating within a loosely bounded network. Data collection will comprise semistructured interviews, document reviews, and focus groups. Individual case studies will be conducted and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Following this, our comparative analysis will operationalize resource-based theory to compare case study data and generate explanations for our research question. This project was funded from 2020 to 2023. Individual case studies were carried out between November 2020 and August 2022. The comparative case analysis will begin in December 2022 and is expected to conclude in April 2023. Submission of the publication is projected for June 2023. By investigating health systems as complex adaptive systems and making comparisons across provinces, this study will identify how health systems can improve the delivery of LDKT to patients with kidney failure. Our resource-based theory framework will provide a granular analysis of the attributes and processes that facilitate or create barriers to LDKT delivery across multiple organizations and levels of practice. Our findings will have practice and policy implications and help inform transferrable competencies and system-level interventions conducive to increasing LDKT. DERR1-10.2196/44172.",

      "abstract": "Delayed graft function (DGF) increases the renal allograft failure risk. Late-onset Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection's effect on the association between DGF and allograft failure has not been determined. In this retrospective cohort, we included all renal allograft recipients at London Health Sciences Centre from January 1, 2014 to December 30, 2017, and continued clinical follow-up until February 28, 2020. We determined whether late-onset CMV infection affects the association between DGF and allograft failure in stratified and Cox proportional hazard analyses. Of 384 patients (median age [interquartile range]: 55 [43.3-63]; 38.7% female), 57 recipients (14.8%) were diagnosed with DGF. Patients with DGF were at a greater risk of CMV infection than patients without DGF (22.8% vs. 11.3%, p = .017). Late-onset CMV infection (odds ratio [OR]: 4.7, 95% CI: 2.07-10.68) and rejection (OR: 9.59, 95% CI: 4.15-22.16) significantly increased the risk of allograft failure in recipients with DGF. Patients with DGF had a significantly greater risk of graft failure than those without DGF (17.5% vs. 6.1%, p = .007). In the adjusted Cox hazard model, CMV infection significantly increased the risk of allograft failure (aHR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.49-6.84). Late-onset CMV infection considerably increased the risk of graft failure in patients with DGF. A hybrid preventive model including prophylaxis followed by CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity monitoring may decrease the risk of allograft failure in recipients with DGF.",

We analyzed a multicenter cohort that included several features typically used to determine an individual's level of frailty. We present a clustering based phenotyping approach, where we investigated two clustering approaches-i.e. neural network based Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with hierarchical clustering, and KAMILA (KAy-means for MIxed LArge data sets).

      "abstract": "Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), also known as T-cell Ig and mucin domain-1 (TIM-1), is a widely recognized biomarker for AKI, but its biological function is less appreciated. KIM-1/TIM-1 belongs to the T-cell Ig and mucin domain family of conserved transmembrane proteins, which bear the characteristic six-cysteine Ig-like variable domain. The latter enables binding of KIM-1/TIM-1 to its natural ligand, phosphatidylserine, expressed on the surface of apoptotic cells and necrotic cells. KIM-1/TIM-1 is expressed in a variety of tissues and plays fundamental roles in regulating sterile inflammation and adaptive immune responses. In the kidney, KIM-1 is upregulated on injured renal proximal tubule cells, which transforms them into phagocytes for clearance of dying cells and helps to dampen sterile inflammation. TIM-1, expressed in T cells, B cells, and natural killer T cells, is essential for cell activation and immune regulatory functions in the host. Functional polymorphisms in the gene for KIM-1/TIM-1, HAVCR1 , have been associated with susceptibility to immunoinflammatory conditions and hepatitis A virus-induced liver failure, which is thought to be due to a differential ability of KIM-1/TIM-1 variants to bind phosphatidylserine. This review will summarize the role of KIM-1/TIM-1 in health and disease and its potential clinical applications as a biomarker and therapeutic target in humans.",

      "abstract": "Organ transplantation is associated with various forms of programmed cell death which can accelerate transplant injury and rejection. Targeting cell death in donor organs may represent a novel strategy for preventing allograft injury. We have previously demonstrated that necroptosis plays a key role in promoting transplant injury. Recently, we have found that mitochondria function is linked to necroptosis. However, it remains unknown how necroptosis signaling pathways regulate mitochondrial function during necroptosis. In this study, we investigated the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis. We demonstrate that the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) family members CaMK1, 2, and 4 form a complex with RIPK3 in mouse cardiac endothelial cells, to promote trans-phosphorylation during necroptosis. CaMK1 and 4 directly activated the dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1), while CaMK2 indirectly activated Drp1 via the phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5). The inhibition of CaMKs restored mitochondrial function and effectively prevented endothelial cell death. CaMKs inhibition inhibited activation of CaMKs and Drp1, and cell death and heart tissue injury (n = 6/group, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) in a murine model of cardiac transplantation. Importantly, the inhibition of CaMKs greatly prolonged heart graft survival (n = 8/group, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, CaMK family members orchestrate cell death in two different pathways and may be potential therapeutic targets in preventing cell death and transplant injury.",

      "abstract": "Vascular calcification is prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Genetic causes of CKD account for 10-20% of adult-onset disease. Vascular calcification is thought to be one of the most important risk factors for increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients and is detectable in 80% of patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Despite the high prevalence of vascular calcification in CKD, no single gene cause has been described. We hypothesized that variants in vascular calcification genes may contribute to disease pathogenesis in CKD, particularly in families who exhibit a predominant vascular calcification phenotype. We developed a list of eight genes that are hypothesized to play a role in vascular calcification due to their involvement in the ectopic calcification pathway: ABCC6, ALPL, ANK1, ENPP1, NT5E, SLC29A1, SLC20A2, and S100A12. With this, we assessed exome data from 77 CKD patients, who remained unsolved following evaluation for all known monogenic causes of CKD. We also analyzed an independent cohort (Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI), n&#xa0;=&#xa0;520) who were screened for variants in ABCC6 and compared this to a control cohort of healthy adults (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;52). We identified two CKD families with heterozygous pathogenic variants (R1141X and A667fs) in ABCC6. We identified 10 participants from the ONDRI cohort with heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in ABCC6. Replication in a healthy control cohort did not reveal any variants. Our study provides preliminary data supporting the hypothesis that ABCC6 may play a role in vascular calcification in CKD. By screening CKD patients for genetic causes early in the diagnostic pathway, patients with genetic causes associated with vascular calcification can potentially be preventatively treated with new therapeutics with aims to decrease mortality.",

      "abstract": "NK cells participate in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and transplant rejection. Endogenous regulatory systems may exist to attenuate NK cell activation and cytotoxicity in IRI associated with kidney transplantation. A greater understanding of NK regulation will provide insights in transplant outcomes and could direct new therapeutic strategies. Kidney tubular epithelial cells (TECs) may negatively regulate NK cell activation by their surface expression of a complex family of C-type lectin-related proteins (Clrs). We have found that Clr-b and Clr-f were expressed by TECs. Clr-b was upregulated by inflammatory cytokines TNF&#x3b1; and IFN&#x3b3; <i>in vitro</i>. Silencing of both Clr-b and Clr-f expression using siRNA resulted in increased NK cell killing of TECs compared to silencing of either Clr-b or Clr-f alone (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.01) and when compared to control TECs (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). NK cells treated <i>in vitro</i> with soluble Clr-b and Clr-f proteins reduced their capacity to kill TECs (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). Hence, NK cell cytotoxicity can be inhibited by Clr proteins on the surface of TECs. Our study suggests a synergistic effect of Clr molecules in regulating NK cell function in renal cells and this may represent an important endogenous regulatory system to limit NK cell-mediated organ injury during inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Living donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) is the best treatment option for patients with kidney failure. Efforts to increase LDKT have focused on microlevel interventions and the need for systems thinking has been highlighted. We aimed to identify and compare health system-level attributes and processes that are facilitators and barriers to LDKT. We conducted a qualitative comparative case study analysis of 3 Canadian provincial health care systems with variable LDKT performance (Quebec: low, Ontario: moderate-high, British Columbia: high). Data collection entailed semistructured interviews (<i>n</i>&#xa0;= 91), document review (<i>n</i>&#xa0;= 97) and focus groups (<i>n</i>&#xa0;= 5 with 40 participants), analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Our findings showed a strong relationship between the degree of centralized coordination between governing organizations and the capacity to deliver LDKT as follows. (i) macro-level coordination between governing organizations in British Columbia and Ontario increased capacities, whereas Qu&#xe9;bec was seen as decentralized with little formal coordination; (ii) a higher degree of centralized coordination facilitated more effective resource deployment in the form of human resources and initiatives in British Columbia and Ontario, whereas in Qu&#xe9;bec resource deployment relied on hospital budgets leading to competition for resources and reduced capacity of initiatives; (iii) informal resource sharing through strong communities of practice and local champions facilitated LDKT in Ontario and British Columbia and was limited in Qu&#xe9;bec. Our findings suggest that interventions that account for full-system function, particularly macro-level coordination between governing organizations can improve LDKT delivery. Findings may be used to guide structured organizational change toward increasing LDKT and mitigating the global burden of kidney failure.",

      "abstract": "Highly sensitized patients (HSPs) with kidney failure have limited access to kidney transplantation and poorer post-transplant outcomes. Prioritizing HSPs in kidney allocation systems and expanding the pool of deceased donors available to them has helped to reduce their wait times for transplant and enhanced post-transplant outcomes. The Canadian HSP Program was established by Canadian Blood Services in collaboration with provincial organ donation and transplantation programs throughout the country to increase transplant opportunities for transplant candidates needing very specific matches from deceased kidney donors. Highly sensitized patients in the Canadian Program are defined by a calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) &#x2265;95%. In this report, we describe the evolution and trajectory of the Canadian HSP Program and evaluate the national impact on the first 1000 kidney transplant cases. To allocate deceased donor kidney organs nationally to HSPs and report on the Canadian HSP Program's performance, Canadian Blood Services developed a national database registry known as the Canadian Transplant Registry (CTR) and an online reporting tool known as the Canadian HSP Program Data Dashboard. The CTR, which collects HSPs' data for the purpose of matching potential donors to HSPs and as part of required national quality, safety, and efficiency performance measurements, was retrospectively reviewed. Due to the nature of using deidentified aggregate registry data, a patient consent form was not required. A Research Ethical Board (REB) application was also waived. In this article, we describe the historical development, initial deployment, and evolution of the Canadian HSP Program with a primary aim to increase the rate of deceased donor kidney transplantation. A secondary aim was to evaluate the national impact of the Canadian HSP Program on the first 1000 kidney transplant cases. Transplant candidates who have participated in the Canadian HSP Program and recipients who received transplants were predominantly females (average age 50 years, female 62%) with blood group O (47% of candidates, 42% of transplants). Seventy percent of all active transplant candidates enrolled in the HSP Program were in the hardest to match group (cPRA &#x2265;99%), and only 22% of the transplant candidates with cPRA of 100% have received a transplant to date through the Program. The average times from first participation in the Canadian HSP Program to transplantation for cPRA &#x2265;99% transplant recipients were significantly longer than for cPRA 95% to 98% recipients averaging 22 months versus 6 months, respectively. By the end of June 2024, the Canadian HSP Program had facilitated 1000 transplants, 613 of which were from interprovincial matches. The average (SD) cold ischemic time (CIT) was 14.5 (5.9) hours, with interprovincial transplants exhibiting significantly longer CITs compared with intraprovincial transplants, averaging an additional 4.7 hours. Our study limitations include first that it is a retrospective registry data analysis with no available short- and long-term clinical outcomes data at this point (patient and graft survival). Second, given the nature of registry data, not all relevant data may have been captured and reporting may not be complete for all patients. Examination of CTR registry data showed the Canadian HSP Program had a meaningful impact in enabling 1000 HSPs to access transplantation opportunities that may otherwise be unavailable to them. Les patients hyperimmunis&#xe9;s (PHI) atteints d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale ont un acc&#xe8;s limit&#xe9; &#xe0; la transplantation et pr&#xe9;sentent de moins bons r&#xe9;sultats apr&#xe8;s la greffe.

Dans cet article, nous d&#xe9;crivons le d&#xe9;veloppement, le d&#xe9;ploiement initial et l&#x2019;&#xe9;volution du PPHI dans l&#x2019;objectif premier d&#x2019;augmenter le taux de transplantation r&#xe9;nale avec donneurs d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9;s. Un objectif secondaire &#xe9;tait d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuer l&#x2019;impact du PPHI &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;chelle nationale sur les 1 000 premi&#xe8;res transplantations r&#xe9;nales. Les candidats &#xe0; la transplantation qui ont particip&#xe9; au PPHI et qui ont re&#xe7;u une greffe &#xe9;taient majoritairement des femmes (62 %; &#xe2;ge moyen: 50 ans) de groupe sanguin O (47 % des candidats; 42 % des greff&#xe9;s). De tous les candidats &#xe0; la transplantation actifs qui &#xe9;taient inscrits au PPHI, 70 % faisaient partie du groupe le plus difficile &#xe0; jumeler (PRAc &#x2265; 99%) et seulement 22 % des candidats &#xe0; la transplantation avec un PRAc de 100 % ont re&#xe7;u une greffe &#xe0; ce jour dans le cadre du Programme. Pour les receveurs avec un PRAc &#x2265;99 %, les d&#xe9;lais moyens entre la premi&#xe8;re participation au programme et la transplantation &#xe9;taient significativement plus longs que pour les receveurs avec un PRAc de 95 &#xe0; 98 % (moyenne de 22 mois c. 6 mois). &#xc0; la fin de juin 2024, le PPHI avait facilit&#xe9; 1 000 transplantations, dont 613 jumelages interprovinciaux. Le temps moyen (&#xe9;cart-type) d&#x2019;isch&#xe9;mie froide &#xe9;tait de 14,5 (5,9) heures, les greffes interprovinciales pr&#xe9;sentant des p&#xe9;riodes d&#x2019;isch&#xe9;mie froide significativement plus longues que les greffes intraprovinciales, soit de 4,7 heures plus longues en moyenne. Notre &#xe9;tude est limit&#xe9;e par le fait qu&#x2019;il s&#x2019;agit d&#x2019;une analyse r&#xe9;trospective des donn&#xe9;es de registres sans donn&#xe9;es disponibles sur les r&#xe9;sultats cliniques &#xe0; court et &#xe0; long terme &#xe0; ce stade (survie du patient et du greffon). Aussi, compte tenu de la nature des donn&#xe9;es de registre, il est possible que toutes les donn&#xe9;es pertinentes n&#x2019;aient pas &#xe9;t&#xe9; saisies et que les rapports ne soient pas complets pour tous les patients. L&#x2019;examen des donn&#xe9;es du RCT a montr&#xe9; que le Programme canadien des PHI avait eu un impact significatif en permettant &#xe0; un millier de patients hyperimmunis&#xe9;s d&#x2019;acc&#xe9;der &#xe0; des possibilit&#xe9;s de transplantation qui pourraient autrement leur &#xea;tre indisponibles. Les patients hyperimmunis&#xe9;s (PHI) atteints d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale ont un acc&#xe8;s limit&#xe9; &#xe0; la transplantation r&#xe9;nale et pr&#xe9;sentent de moins bons r&#xe9;sultats post-transplantation. Am&#xe9;liorer la transplantation r&#xe9;nale pour les PHI est un d&#xe9;fi mondial. Partout dans le monde, le fait d&#x2019;accorder une priorit&#xe9; aux PHI dans les syst&#xe8;mes d&#x2019;allocation des reins a permis d&#x2019;augmenter les possibilit&#xe9;s de transplantation, de r&#xe9;duire les temps d&#x2019;attente et d&#x2019;am&#xe9;liorer les r&#xe9;sultats post-transplantation. Le Programme canadien des PHI (PPHI), d&#xe9;velopp&#xe9; par la Soci&#xe9;t&#xe9; canadienne du sang en collaboration avec les programmes provinciaux de don et de transplantation d&#x2019;organes, a facilit&#xe9; avec succ&#xe8;s les greffes de rein pour les PHI canadiens qui ont besoin d&#x2019;une compatibilit&#xe9; tr&#xe8;s sp&#xe9;cifique avec des donneurs de rein d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9;s. Ces patients n&#x2019;auraient peut-&#xea;tre jamais re&#xe7;u une greffe de rein par l&#x2019;entremise de listes d&#x2019;attente provinciales plus petites. Le partage du bassin de donneurs &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;chelle nationale par l&#x2019;entremise du PPHI a entra&#xee;n&#xe9; une augmentation du nombre de greffes r&#xe9;nales chez les receveurs qui sont les plus difficiles &#xe0; jumeler.",

      "abstract": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely used tool for the measurement of kidney function, but endogenous biomarkers such as cystatin C and creatinine have limitations. A previous metabolomic study revealed <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-trimethyl-L-alanyl-L-proline betaine (TMAP) to be reflective of kidney function. In this study, we developed a quantitative LCMS assay for the measurement of TMAP and evaluated TMAP as a biomarker of GFR. An assay to measure TMAP was developed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. After validation of the method, we applied it to plasma samples from three distinct kidney disease patient cohorts: nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, patients receiving peritoneal and hemodialysis, and living kidney donors. We investigated whether TMAP was conserved in other mammalian and nonmammalian species, by analyzing plasma samples from Wistar rats with diet-induced CKD and searching for putative matches to the <i>m/z</i> for TMAP and its known fragments in the raw sample data repository \"Metabolomics Workbench\". The assay can measure plasma TMAP at a lower limit of quantitation (100 ng/mL) with an interday precision and accuracy of 12.8 and 12.1%, respectively. In all three patient cohorts, TMAP concentrations are significantly higher in patients with CKD than in controls with a normal GFR. Further, TMAP concentrations are also elevated in rats with CKD and TMAP is present in the sap produced from <i>Acer saccharum</i> trees. TMAP concentration is inversely related to GFR suggesting that it is a marker of kidney function. TMAP is present in nonmammalian species suggesting that it is part of a biologically conserved process.",

      "abstract": "Continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) is the predominant form of acute kidney replacement therapy used for critically ill adult patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the variability in CKRT practice, a contemporary understanding of its epidemiology is necessary to improve care delivery. Multicenter, prospective living registry. 1,106 critically ill adults with AKI requiring CKRT from December 2013 to January 2021 across 5 academic centers and 6 intensive care units. Patients with pre-existing kidney failure and those with coronavirus 2 infection were excluded. CKRT for more than 24 hours. Hospital mortality, kidney recovery, and health care resource utilization. Data were collected according to preselected timepoints at intensive care unit admission and CKRT initiation and analyzed descriptively. Patients' characteristics, contributors to AKI, and CKRT indications differed among centers. Mean (standard deviation) age was 59.3 (13.9) years, 39.7% of patients were women, and median [IQR] APACHE-II (acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation) score was 30 [25-34]. Overall, 41.1% of patients survived to hospital discharge. Patients that died were older (mean age 61 vs. 56.8, <i>P</i>&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001), had greater comorbidity (median Charlson score 3 [1-4] vs. 2 [1-3], P&#xa0;&lt; 0.001), and higher acuity of illness (median APACHE-II score 30 [25-35] vs. 29 [24-33], <i>P</i>&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.003). The most common condition predisposing to AKI was sepsis (42.6%), and the most common CKRT indications were oliguria/anuria (56.2%) and fluid overload (53.9%). Standardized mortality ratios were similar among centers. The generalizability of these results to CKRT practices in nonacademic centers or low-and middle-income countries is limited. In this registry, sepsis was the major contributor to AKI and fluid management was collectively the most common CKRT indication. Significant heterogeneity in patient- and CKRT-specific characteristics was found in current practice. These data highlight the need for establishing benchmarks of CKRT delivery, performance, and patient outcomes. Data from this registry could assist with the design of such studies.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of mortality among this population. In addition, chronic kidney disease is a major risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease and is widely regarded as a coronary artery disease risk equivalent. Medical therapy is the cornerstone of coronary artery disease management in the general population. However, there are few trials to guide medical therapy of coronary artery disease in chronic kidney disease, with most data extrapolated from clinical trials of mainly non-chronic kidney disease patients, which were not adequately powered to evaluate this subgroup. There is some evidence to suggest that the efficacy of certain therapies such as aspirin and statins is attenuated with declining estimated glomerular filtration rate, with questionable benefit among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Furthermore, chronic kidney disease and ESRD patients are at higher risk of potential side effects with therapy, which may limit their use. In this review, we summarize the available evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of medical therapy of coronary artery disease in chronic kidney disease and ESRD patients. We also discuss the data on new emerging therapies, including PCSK9i, SGLT2i, GLP1 receptor agonists, and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, which show promise at reducing risk of cardiovascular events in the chronic kidney disease population and may offer additional treatment options. Overall, dedicated studies directly evaluating chronic kidney disease patients, particularly those with advanced chronic kidney disease and ESRD, are greatly needed to establish the optimal medical therapy for coronary artery disease and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "Declining kidney function in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is often attributed to large lesions, including angiomyolipomas (AMLs) and cysts, that encroach on the normal parenchyma or that require intervention and loss of parenchyma from surgical debulking or embolization. Consequently, research on inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a protein complex implicated in TSC pathophysiology for its role in promoting cell growth and proliferation, has largely focused on their ability to reduce AML size. Clinical guidelines distilled from this research limit mTOR inhibition as a first-line treatment to patients with large AMLs. However, chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in patients without large AMLs or a history of renal intervention. Alternate mechanisms postulated for CKD in TSC may suggest a role for mTOR inhibition in this population. In this report, we present 2 cases of a microscopic variant of TSC kidney disease causing declining kidney function, as well as anecdotal evidence for the use of mTOR inhibition to improve kidney function in the absence of large AMLs. We highlight the importance of annual kidney function assessment in patients with TSC and suggest a low threshold for kidney biopsy in patients with declining glomerular filtration rate without a clear etiology clinically or radiographically.",

      "abstract": "We previously published a retrospective study of kidney biopsies performed in a tertiary care hospital in London, Ontario from 2012 to 2017. This study resulted in a change of practice in our institution to shorter postbiopsy monitoring for outpatients as well as the development of a risk calculator to predict serious bleeding complications. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether this shorter monitoring time is adequate in the outpatient setting. A secondary objective was to validate the bleeding risk calculator in both inpatients and outpatients. This was a retrospective chart review. This study was performed at a tertiary academic hospital in London, Ontario, Canada. This was a retrospective study of 400 adult patients who underwent kidney biopsy between April 30, 2018 and February 25, 2022 at a tertiary academic hospital in London, Canada. We retrospectively assessed frequency and timing of major bleeding complications in patients who underwent kidney biopsy. In secondary analyses, we examined the prediction performance of the risk calculator in discrimination and calibration. Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (1.8%). Five of these patients required blood transfusions (1.3%) and 2 required embolization (0.5%). In the outpatient setting, any major bleeding events were identified immediately (1 patient) or on the routine 2-hour ultrasounds (1 patient). The risk calculator showed good discrimination (C-statistic, 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.84 to 0.95]) and calibration (slope, 1.10, 95% CI = [0.47 to 1.74]; intercept, 95% CI = -0.02 [-0.79 to 0.75]), but with much uncertainty in the estimates. The occurrence of only a few major bleeding events limits the reliability of our assessment of our risk calculator. There appears to be little yield in extending observation beyond 2 hours after an outpatient kidney biopsy with the use of immediate and 2-hour postbiopsy ultrasounds. The bleeding risk calculator (http://perioperativerisk.com/kbrc) warrants further validation. Nous avons publi&#xe9; pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;demment une &#xe9;tude r&#xe9;trospective des biopsies r&#xe9;nales effectu&#xe9;es entre 2012 et 2017 dans un h&#xf4;pital de soins tertiaires de London, en Ontario.

Dans les analyses secondaires, nous avons examin&#xe9; la puissance pr&#xe9;dictive du calculateur de risque en mati&#xe8;re de discrimination et d&#x2019;&#xe9;talonnage. Sept patients (1,75 %) ont subi une h&#xe9;morragie majeure; de ces patients, cinq ont eu besoin de transfusions sanguines (1,3 %) et deux, d&#x2019;une embolisation (0,5 %). En contexte ambulatoire, tous les &#xe9;v&#xe9;nements h&#xe9;morragiques graves ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; d&#xe9;tect&#xe9;s imm&#xe9;diatement (un patient) ou lors de l&#x2019;&#xe9;chographie de routine &#xe0; deux heures (un patient).

Of 166 ECD recipients, 49 (29.5%) were DCD and 117 (70.5%) were NDD. Delayed graft function was higher in the DCD/ECD group 61.2 % vs 32.0 % among NDD/ECD recipients. Graft loss was significantly increased among DCD/ECD (hazard ratio for graft loss 4.81 [95% CI1.78-13.01], P = .002 at 1 year and 2.03 [95% CI 1.03-4.0], P = .042 at 3 years).

      "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a monogenetic disorder associated with sustained mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, leading to heterogeneous clinical manifestations. Epilepsy and renal angiomyolipoma are the most important causes of morbidity in adult people with TSC (pwTSC). mTOR is a key player in inflammation, which in turn could influence TSC-related clinical manifestations. Reliable biomarkers are lacking to monitor and predict evolution and response to treatment for epilepsy in pwTSC. Inflammation has been implicated in epileptogenesis in non-TSC-related epilepsy. We aimed to characterize the relation between markers of neuroglial activation/injury, markers of peripheral inflammation, and active epilepsy in pwTSC to identify accessible biomarkers and potential new therapeutic targets. We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate markers of central nervous system (CNS) (neurofilament light [NfL] and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and peripheral (45 cytokines) inflammation in the peripheral blood of pwTSC (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;46) vs age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26). In pwTSC, markers associated with active epilepsy (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;23/46) were compared to non-TSC epilepsy controls (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;18). Observations on markers of neuroglial activation/injury (GFAP, NfL) were confirmed in an independent TSC cohort (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;45; 69% with active epilepsy). We report that TSC is characterized by elevated serum levels of marker of astrogliosis (GFAP), pro-inflammatory molecules (interleukin 1&#x3b2; [IL-1&#x3b2;], CXCL8) and trophic factor (epidermal growth factor [EGF]) compared to HCs and to non-TSC-related epilepsy controls. Among pwTSC, renal angiomyolipoma presence and size was associated with IL-15. It is notable that active epilepsy in pwTSC was associated with higher levels of GFAP compared to pwTSC without epilepsy, which was confirmed in an external validation cohort, and with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17A, IL-17C, tumor necrosis factor &#x3b1; [TNF-&#x3b1;]), not significantly related to seizure activity or treatment with mTOR inhibitor. These associations remained significant after adjusting for age and sex. These results suggest that key inflammatory mediators could contribute to epileptogenesis and represent novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in TSC.",

      "abstract": "Sporadic renal cell carcinomas with fibromyomatous stroma (RCC FMS) with coexistent haemangioblastoma (HB)-like morphology have been previously reported. Such morphology has not, however, been documented in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We evaluated clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular findings of RCC FMS with HB-like features in three TSC patients. All three patients were females with confirmed germline mutations in TSC1 in the absence of VHL or other alterations. One patient had bilateral nephrectomy with six separate tumours (three in each kidney), and two patients had one tumour each, resected by partial nephrectomy. Prominent fibromuscular stroma was present at the tumoral periphery and surrounding clear cell nests forming tubules and papillary formations (RCC FMS areas), admixed with solid, clear to eosinophilic and spindle cell areas (HB-like areas). HB-like areas were variably represented in individual tumours, but in some, HB-like features were almost exclusive. HB-like areas were negative for CK7 and showed inhibin-&#x3b1; and S100 reactivity, in contrast to typical RCC FMS areas, which were CK7 positive, while negative for inhibin-&#x3b1; and S100. GPNMB, which is consistently expressed in TSC/mTOR altered tumours, was positive in both components. On follow-up (10 months-21&#x2009;years), all patients had an indolent course. HB-like morphology found in RCC FMS in TSC patients represents part of the morphologic spectrum of RCC FMS, which is a previously underreported and underrecognized feature. RCC FMS with HB-like areas show uniform GPNMB reactivity and are associated with TSC/MTOR alterations, but not with VHL alterations.",

      "abstract": "To document prophylactic practices, infection patterns, and disease burden to inform strategies for CMV management in high-risk kidney transplant recipients. A retrospective cohort of 311 consecutive CMV D+/R- kidney recipients were enrolled from 7 Canadian programs over 4 years (2018-2021) to provide data on demographic, clinical, therapeutic and health resource use during the 1st year post-transplant. Themedian age was 58 (46, 67) years, 69% were male, and 53% were White. Diabetes was the principal cause of kidney failure (19%). 208 (69%) received a deceased donor graft; 76 (24%) had ATG induction, and 84% had maintenance therapy with tacrolimus and MMF/MPA &#xb1; prednisone. All received antiviral prophylaxis, 90% with valganciclovir, for a median of 180 days. 106 (34%) developed CMV viremia (median peak viral load 14,224 IU/ml) at a median of 218 days, of whom 46 (43%) had CMV disease and 15 (14%) had recurrent infection. Myelotoxicity occurred in 121 (39%) patients at a median of 88 days, lasting a median of 30 days. Opportunistic infections occurred in 119 patients (38%) at a median of 53 days. 141 patients (45%) were hospitalized, 50 (16%) more than once. 20 patients (6%) had biopsy-confirmed rejection, and 293 (94%) were alive with a functioning graft at 1 year. Current prophylaxis strategies fail to prevent CMV infection in 34% of high-risk patients. Myelotoxicity, opportunistic infection, reduced immunosuppression, and hospitalization remain common and serious complications. More effective and less toxic personalized treatment strategies are required to minimize these risks and burdens.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at kidney transplant recipients in Canada who were at higher risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Researchers found that despite antiviral prevention, a significant number of patients still developed CMV, along with other serious complications like blood problems and opportunistic infections.  The findings highlight the need for improved, personalized treatment approaches to better protect these patients after a kidney transplant."

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized children and is associated with increased hospital length of stay and costs. However, there are limited data on postdischarge health care utilization after AKI hospitalization. Our objectives were to evaluate health care utilization and physician follow-up patterns after dialysis-treated AKI in a pediatric population. Retrospective cohort study, using provincial health administrative databases. All children (0-18 years) hospitalized between 1996 and 2017 in Ontario, Canada. Excluded individuals comprised non-Ontario residents; those with metabolic disorders or poisoning; and those who received dialysis or kidney transplant before admission, a kidney transplant by 104 days after discharge, or were receiving dialysis 76-104 days from dialysis start date. Episodes of dialysis-treated AKI, identified using validated health administrative codes. AKI survivors were matched to 4 hospitalized controls without dialysis-treated AKI by age, sex, and admission year. Our primary outcome was postdischarge hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and outpatient physician visits. Secondary outcomes included outpatient visits by physician type and composite health care costs. Proportions with&#x2265;1 event and rates (per 1,000 person-years). Total and median composite health care costs. Adjusted rate ratios using negative binomial regression models. We included 1,688 pediatric dialysis-treated AKI survivors and 6,752 matched controls. Dialysis-treated AKI survivors had higher rehospitalization and emergency department visit rates during the analyzed follow-up periods (0-1, 0-5, and 0-10 years postdischarge, and throughout follow-up), and higher outpatient visit rates in the 0-1-year follow-up period. The overall adjusted rate ratio for rehospitalization was 1.46 (95% CI, 1.25-1.69; P&lt;0.0001) and for outpatient visits was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.09-1.23; P=0.01). Dialysis-treated AKI survivors also had higher health care costs. Nephrologist follow-up was infrequent among dialysis-treated AKI survivors (18.6% by 1 year postdischarge). Potential miscoding of study exposures or outcomes. Residual uncontrolled confounding. Data for health care costs and emergency department visits was unavailable before 2006 and 2001, respectively. Dialysis-treated AKI survivors had greater postdischarge health care utilization and costs versus hospitalized controls. Strategies are needed to improve follow-up care for children after dialysis-treated AKI to prevent long-term complications.",

Prospective cohort. Hospital survivors from the ASSESS-AKI (Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney Injury) and ARID (AKI Risk in Derby) studies with and without AKI during the index hospitalization who had baseline serum samples for biomarker measurements. We measured sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 from plasma samples obtained 3 months after discharge. The associations of biomarkers with longitudinal kidney disease incidence and progression, heart failure, and death were evaluated. Cox proportional hazard models. Among 1,474 participants with plasma biomarker measurements, 19% had kidney disease progression, 14% had later heart failure, and 21% died during a median follow-up of 4.4 years. For the kidney outcome, the adjusted HRs (AHRs) per doubling in concentration were 2.9 (95% CI, 2.2-3.9) for sTNFR1 and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.5-2.5) for sTNFR2. AKI during the index hospitalization did not modify the association between biomarkers and kidney events. For heart failure, the AHRs per doubling in concentration were 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.5) for sTNFR1 and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-2.0) for sTNFR2. For mortality, the AHRs were 3.3 (95% CI, 2.5-4.3) for sTNFR1 and 2.5 (95% CI, 2.0-3.1) for sTNFR2. The findings in ARID were qualitatively similar in terms of the magnitude of association between biomarkers and outcomes. Different biomarker platforms and AKI definitions; limited generalizability to other ethnic groups. Plasma sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 measured 3 months after hospital discharge were independently associated with clinical events regardless of AKI status during the index admission. sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 may assist with the risk stratification of patients during follow-up.",

We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)]. We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada involving adults &#x2265;66&#xa0;years of age newly treated with TMP-SMX (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;58&#xa0;999) matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008-2020).

We pooled findings from five retrospective cohorts (2011-18) across Australia and Canada of adults with; a new dispensation for a DOAC or warfarin, an AF diagnosis, and a measure of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The outcomes of interest, within 1 year from the cohort entry date, were: (1) the composite of all-cause death, first hospitalization for ischaemic stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (effectiveness), and (2) first hospitalization for major bleeding defined as an intracranial, upper or lower gastrointestinal, or other bleeding (safety).

Patients hospitalized with AKI in Ontario, Canada, from February 1, 2013, through September 30, 2017, at a single clinical center, who were not receiving dialysis when discharged. Standardized assessment by a nephrologist. Time to a major adverse kidney event, defined as death, initiation of maintenance dialysis, or incident/progressive chronic kidney disease. Propensity scores were used to match each patient who attended an AKI follow-up clinic to 4 patients who received standard care. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess the association between the care within an AKI follow-up clinic and outcomes. To avoid immortal time bias, we randomly assigned index dates to the comparator group. We matched 164 patients from the AKI follow-up clinic to 656 patients who received standard care. During a mean follow-up of 2.2&#xb1;1.3 (SD) years, care in the AKI follow-up clinic was not associated with a reduction in major adverse kidney events relative to standard care (22.1 vs 24.7 events per 100 patient-years; HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.75-1.11]). The AKI follow-up clinic was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.55-0.91]). Patients aged at least 66 years who attended the AKI follow-up clinic were more likely to receive &#x3b2;-blockers (HR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.02-1.77]) and statins (HR, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05-1.74]), but not angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.94-1.56]). Single-center study and residual confounding. Specialized postdischarge follow-up for AKI survivors was not associated with a lower risk of major adverse kidney events but was associated with a lower risk of death and increased prescriptions for some cardioprotective medications.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is common and associated with short- and long-term major cardiovascular events. Diagnostic criteria for MINS using Abbott high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) are unknown. We performed a prospective cohort study of adults who had in-patient noncardiac surgery and measured hs-cTnI (Abbott Laboratories) on postoperative serum samples collected up to postoperative day 3. The objective was to determine prognostically important hs-cTnI thresholds associated with major cardiac events and death at 30 days after noncardiac surgery. Using Cox proportional iterative analyses, we determined peak postoperative hs-cTnI thresholds associated with the occurrence of the 30-day composite of major cardiac events (ie, nonfatal myocardial infarction after 3 postoperative days, cardiac arrest, and congestive heart failure) and death. Of 3953 included patients, 66 (1.7%) experienced the primary outcome at 30 days. Peak hs-cTnI values and associated incidence of major cardiac events and death were as follows: &lt; 60 ng/L: 1.0% (95% CI 0.7-1.3); 60 to &lt; 700 ng/L: 8.6% (5.6-13.0); and &#x2265; 700 ng/L: 27.3% (16.4-41.9). Compared with peak hs-cTnI &lt; 60 ng/L, adjusted hazard ratios were 7.54 (95% CI% 4.27-13.32) for hs-cTnI values of 60 to &lt; 700 ng/L and 26.87 (13.27-54.41) for values &#x2265; 700 ng/L. Hs-cTnI elevation within the first 3 days after noncardiac surgery independently predicts major cardiac events and death at 30 days. A postoperative hs-cTnI &#x2265; 60 ng/L was associated with a &gt; 7-fold increase in the risk of subsequent major cardiac events and mortality at 30 days.",

Mean age was 53 (standard deviation 17) years and mean eGFR was 89 mL/min/1.73 m2, 15% had diabetes and 8.4% had urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) available (median 13 mg/g); 9.5% had prevalent CHD, 3.2% prior stroke, 3.3% HF, and 4.4% prior AF. During follow-up, there were 269 142 CHD, 311 021 stroke, 712 556 HF, and 605 596 AF incident events and 101 044 (0.4%) patients experienced KFRT. Both prevalent and incident CVD were associated with subsequent KFRT with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.9-3.3], 2.0 (1.9-2.1), 4.5 (4.2-4.9), 2.8 (2.7-3.1) after incident CHD, stroke, HF and AF, respectively. HRs were highest in first 3 months post-CVD incidence declining to baseline after 3 years. Incident HF hospitalizations showed the strongest association with KFRT [HR 46 (95% CI: 43-50) within 3 months] after adjustment for other CVD subtype incidence. Incident CVD events strongly and independently associate with future KFRT risk, most notably after HF, then CHD, stroke, and AF. Optimal strategies for addressing the dramatic risk of KFRT following CVD events are needed.",

      "abstract": "Deprescribing is a patient-centered solution to reducing polypharmacy in patients on hemodialysis (HD). In a deprescribing pilot study, patients were hesitant to participate due to limited understanding of their own medications and their unfamiliarity with the concept of deprescribing. Therefore, patient education materials designed to address these knowledge gaps can overcome barriers to shared decision-making and reduce hesitancy regarding deprescribing. To develop and validate a medication-specific, patient education toolkit (bulletin and video) that will supplement an upcoming nationwide deprescribing program for patients on HD. Patient education tools were developed based on the content of previously validated deprescribing algorithms and literature searches for patients' preferences in education. A preliminary round of validation was completed by 5 clinicians to provide feedback on the accuracy and clarity of the education tools. Then, 3 validation rounds were completed by patients on HD across 3 sites in Vancouver, Winnipeg, and Toronto. Content and face validity were evaluated on a 4-point and 5-point Likert scale, respectively. The content validity index (CVI) score was calculated after each round, and revisions were made based on patient feedback. A total of 105 patients participated in the validation. All 10 education tools achieved content and face validity after 3 rounds. The CVI score was 1.0 for most of the tools, with 0.95 being the lowest value. Face validity ranged from 72% to 100%, with majority scoring above 90%. Ten patient education tools on deprescribing were developed and validated by patients on HD. These validated, medication-specific education tools are the first of its kind for patients on HD and will be used in a nationwide implementation study alongside the validated deprescribing algorithms developed by our research group.

      "abstract": "Pregnancies in women with CKD carry greater risk than pregnancies in the general population. The small number of women in prior studies has limited estimates of this risk, especially among those with advanced CKD. We report the results of a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada, that assessed more than 500,000 pregnancies, including 600 with a baseline eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . The investigation demonstrates increases in risk of different adverse maternal and fetal outcomes with lower eGFR and further risk elevation with baseline proteinuria. CKD is a risk factor for pregnancy complications, but estimates for adverse outcomes come largely from single-center studies with few women with moderate or advanced stage CKD. To investigate the association between maternal baseline eGFR and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of women (not on dialysis or having had a kidney transplant) in Ontario, Canada, who delivered between 2007 and 2019. The study included 565,907 pregnancies among 462,053 women. Administrative health databases captured hospital births, outpatient laboratory testing, and pregnancy complications. We analyzed pregnancies with serum creatinine measured within 2 years of conception up to 30 days after conception and assessed the impact of urine protein where available. The risk of major maternal morbidity, preterm delivery, and low birthweight increased monotonically across declining eGFR categories, with risk increase most notable as eGFR dropped below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . A total of 56 (40%) of the 133 pregnancies with an eGFR &lt;45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 resulted in delivery under 37 weeks, compared with 10% of pregnancies when eGFR exceeded 90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 . Greater proteinuria significantly increased risk within each eGFR category. Maternal and neonatal deaths were rare regardless of baseline eGFR (&lt;0.3% of all pregnancies). Only 7% of women with an eGFR &lt;45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 received dialysis during or immediately after pregnancy. We observed higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with low eGFR with concurrent proteinuria. These results can help inform health care policy, preconception counseling, and pregnancy follow-up in women with CKD.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative atrial fibrillation (AF) and myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) are common complications after noncardiac surgery. Inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both disorders. The COP-AF trial tests the hypothesis that colchicine reduces the incidence of perioperative AF and MINS in patients undergoing major noncardiac thoracic surgery. The 'COlchicine for the Prevention of Perioperative Atrial Fibrillation' (COP-AF) trial is an international, blinded, randomized trial that compares colchicine to placebo in patients aged at least 55 years and undergoing major noncardiac thoracic surgery with general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria include a history of AF and a contraindication to colchicine (eg, severe renal dysfunction). Oral colchicine at a dose of 0.5 mg or matching placebo is given within 4 hours before surgery. Thereafter, patients receive colchicine 0.5 mg or placebo twice daily for a total of 10 days. The 2 independent co-primary outcomes are clinically important perioperative AF (including atrial flutter) and MINS during 14 days of follow-up. The main safety outcomes are sepsis or infection and non-infectious diarrhea. We aim to enroll 3,200 patients from approximately 40 sites across 11 countries to have at least 80% power for the independent evaluation of the 2 co-primary outcomes. The COP-AF main results are expected in 2023. COP-AF is a large randomized and blinded trial designed to determine whether colchicine reduces the risk of perioperative AF or MINS in patients who have major noncardiac thoracic surgery.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS), based on measurement of troponin T, is associated with perioperative major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We therefore determined the high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) thresholds associated with 30 day MACE after non-cardiac surgery. We performed a nested biobank cohort study of 4553 patients from the Vascular Events in Non-Cardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation (VISION) Study. We measured hsTnI (ADVIA Centaur&#xae; hsTnI assay) on postoperative days 1 to 3 in patients &#x2265;45 years undergoing non-cardiac surgery. An iterative Cox proportional hazard model determined peak postoperative hsTnI thresholds independently associated with MACE (i.e., death, myocardial infarction occurring on postoperative day 4 or after, non-fatal cardiac arrest, or congestive heart failure) within 30 days after surgery. MACE occurred in 89/4545 (2.0%) patients. Peak hsTnI values of &lt;75 ng/L, 75 ng/L to &lt;1000 ng/L, and &#x2265;1000 ng/L were associated with 1.2% (95% CI, 0.9-1.6), 7.1% (95% CI, 4.8-10.5), and 25.9% (95% CI, 16.3-38.4) MACE, respectively. Compared to peak hsTnI &lt;75 ng/L, values 75 ng/L to &lt;1000 ng/L and &#x2265;1000 ng/L were associated with adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 4.53 (95% CI, 2.75-7.48) and 16.17 (95% CI, 8.70-30.07), respectively. MACE was observed in 9% of patients with peak hsTnI &#x2265;75 ng/L vs 1% in patients with peak hsTnI &lt;75 ng/L (aHR 5.76; 95% CI, 3.64-9.11). A peak hsTnI &#x2265;75 ng/L was associated with MACE in the presence (aHR 9.35; 95% CI, 5.28-16.55) or absence (aHR 3.99; 95% CI, 2.19-7.25) of ischemic features of myocardial injury. A peak postoperative hsTnI &#x2265;75 ng/L was associated with &gt;5-fold increase in the risk of 30 days MACE compared to levels &lt;75 ng/L. This threshold could be used for MINS diagnosis when the ADVIA Centaur hsTnI assay is used.Clinicaltrials.gov Registration Number: NCT00512109.",

      "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Cannabis consumption for recreational and medical use is increasing worldwide. However, the long-term effects on kidney health and disease are largely unknown. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> <i>Post hoc</i> analysis of cannabis use as a risk factor for kidney disease was performed using data from the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI) study that enrolled hospitalized adults with and without acute kidney injury from four U.S. centers during 2009-2015. Associations between self-reported cannabis consumption and the categorical and continuous outcomes were determined using multivariable Cox regression and linear mixed models, respectively. <b>Results:</b> Over a mean follow-up of 4.5&#xb1;1.8 years, 94 participants without chronic kidney disease (CKD) (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &gt;60&#x2009;mL/min/1.73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup>) who consumed cannabis had similar rates of annual eGFR decline versus 889 nonconsumers (mean difference=-0.02&#x2009;mL/min/1.73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup>/year, <i>p</i>=0.9) and incident CKD (&#x2265;25% reduction in eGFR compared with the 3-month post-hospitalization measured eGFR and achieving CKD stage 3 or higher) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=1.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.7-2.0). Nineteen participants with CKD (eGFR &lt;60&#x2009;mL/min/1.73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup>) who consumed cannabis had more rapid eGFR decline versus 597 nonconsumers (mean difference=-1.3&#x2009;mL/min/1.73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup>/year; <i>p</i>=0.02) that was not independently associated with an increased risk of CKD progression (&#x2265;50% reduction in eGFR compared with the 3-month post-hospitalization eGFR, reaching CKD stage 5, or receiving kidney replacement therapy) (aHR=1.6; 95% CI=0.7-3.5). Cannabis consumption was not associated with the rate of change in urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) over time among those with (<i>p</i>=0.7) or without CKD (<i>p</i>=0.4). <b>Conclusions:</b> Cannabis consumption did not adversely affect the kidney function of participants without CKD but was associated with a faster annual eGFR decline among participants with CKD. Cannabis consumption was not associated with changes in UACR over time, incident CKD, or progressive CKD regardless of baseline kidney function. Additional research is needed to investigate the kidney endocannabinoid system and the impact of cannabis use on kidney disease outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Magnesium is an essential mineral for bone metabolism, but little is known about how magnesium intake alters fracture risk. We conducted a narrative review to better understand how magnesium intake, through supplementation, diet, or altering the concentration of dialysate magnesium, affects mineral bone disease and the risk of fracture in individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease. Peer-reviewed clinical trials and observational studies. We searched for relevant articles in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The methodologic quality of clinical trials was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black criteria checklist. The role of magnesium intake in fracture prevention is unclear in both the general population and in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. In those with normal kidney function, 2 meta-analyses showed higher bone mineral density in those with higher dietary magnesium, whereas 1 systematic review showed no effect on fracture risk. In patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, a higher concentration of dialysate magnesium is associated with a lower concentration of parathyroid hormone, but little is known about other bone-related outcomes. In 2 observational studies of patients receiving hemodialysis, a higher concentration of serum magnesium was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. This narrative review included only articles written in English. Observed effects of magnesium intake in the general population may not be applicable to those with chronic kidney disease particularly in those receiving dialysis. Le magn&#xe9;sium est un min&#xe9;ral essentiel pour le m&#xe9;tabolisme osseux, mais on en sait peu sur la fa&#xe7;on dont un apport en magn&#xe9;sium modifie le risque de fracture.

Essais cliniques et &#xe9;tudes observationnelles examin&#xe9;s par des pairs. Nous avons r&#xe9;pertori&#xe9; les articles pertinents dans les bases de donn&#xe9;es MEDLINE et EMBASE.

Le r&#xf4;le d&#x2019;un apport en magn&#xe9;sium dans la pr&#xe9;vention des fractures n&#x2019;est pas clair, tant dans la population g&#xe9;n&#xe9;rale que chez les patients sous dialyse d&#x2019;entretien. Chez les personnes ayant une fonction r&#xe9;nale normale, deux m&#xe9;ta-analyses ont montr&#xe9; que les personnes dont le r&#xe9;gime alimentaire est riche en magn&#xe9;sium pr&#xe9;sentent une densit&#xe9; min&#xe9;rale osseuse plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9;e; alors qu&#x2019;une revue syst&#xe9;matique n&#x2019;a montr&#xe9; aucun effet sur le risque de fracture. Chez les patients sous h&#xe9;modialyse d&#x2019;entretien ou dialyse p&#xe9;riton&#xe9;ale, une concentration plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9;e de dialysat de magn&#xe9;sium est associ&#xe9;e &#xe0; une plus faible concentration d&#x2019;hormone parathyro&#xef;dienne, mais on en sait peu sur les autres effets li&#xe9;s aux os.

      "abstract": "Patients who survive acute kidney injury (AKI) may receive fewer cardioprotective drugs. Our objective was to measure the difference in time to dispensing of evidence-based cardiovascular drugs in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with and without AKI. This was a population-based cohort study of patients 66 years of age and older with a history of MI who survived a hospitalization complicated with AKI, propensity-score matched to patients without AKI. The primary outcome was time to outpatient dispensing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), statin, or &#x3b2;-blocker within 1 year of hospital discharge. We identified 28,871 patients with AKI, of whom 21,452 were matched 1:1 to patients without AKI. In the matched cohort, mean age was 80 years, 40% were female, and 34% had an MI during the index hospitalization. AKI was associated with less frequent dispensing of all 3 cardiovascular drug classes within 1 year of hospital discharge (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-0.95). This association was most pronounced in patients with stage 2 (sHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.88) and stage 3 (sHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64-0.79) AKI. We observed less frequent dispensing of statins in patients with stage 2 (sHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.92) and stage 3 (sHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93) AKI and less frequent dispensing of &#x3b2;-blockers in patients with stage 3 AKI (sHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94). In patients with a history of MI, survivors of AKI were less likely to receive prescriptions for ACEi/ARB, statins, or &#x3b2;-blockers within 1 year of hospital discharge. This association was most pronounced in patients with stages 2 and 3 AKI.",

Animal studies and small human trials suggest that curcumin reduces albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Micro-particle curcumin is a new, more bioavailable formulation of curcumin. To determine whether micro-particle curcumin versus placebo slows the progression of albuminuric CKD we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 6-month follow-up. We included adults with albuminuria [a random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio &gt;30&#xa0;mg/mmol (265&#xa0;mg/g) or a 24-h urine collection with more than 300&#xa0;mg of protein] and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 15 and 60&#xa0;mL/min/1.73 m2 within the 3&#xa0;months before randomization. We randomly allocated participants 1:1 to receive micro-particle curcumin capsules (90&#xa0;mg/day) or matching placebo for 6&#xa0;months. After randomization, the co-primary outcomes were the changes in albuminuria and the eGFR. We enrolled 533 participants, but 4/265 participants in the curcumin group and 15/268 in the placebo group withdrew consent or became ineligible.

      "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend that living kidney donors receive lifelong annual follow-up care to monitor kidney health. In the United States, the reporting of complete clinical and laboratory data for kidney donors has been mandated for the first 2 years post-donation; however, the long-term impact of early guideline-concordant care remains unclear. The primary objective of this study was to compare long-term post-donation follow-up care and clinical outcomes of living kidney donors with and without early guideline-concordant follow-up care. Retrospective, population-based cohort study. Linked health care databases were used to identify kidney donors in Alberta, Canada. Four hundred sixty living kidney donors who underwent nephrectomy between 2002 and 2013. The primary outcome was continued annual follow-up at 5 and 10 years (adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval, <sub>LCL</sub>aOR<sub>UCL</sub>). Secondary outcomes included mean change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time and rates of all-cause hospitalization. We compared long-term follow-up and clinical outcomes for donors with and without early guideline-concordant care, defined as annual physician visit and serum creatinine and albuminuria measurement for the first 2 years post-donation. Of the 460 donors included in this study, 187 (41%) had clinical and laboratory evidence of guideline-concordant follow-up care throughout the first 2 years post-donation. The odds of receiving annual follow-up for donors without early guideline-concordant care were 76% lower at 5 years (aOR <sub>0.18</sub>0.24<sub>0.32</sub>) and 68% lower at 10 years (aOR <sub>0.23</sub>0.32<sub>0.46</sub>) compared with donors with early care. The odds of continuing follow-up remained stable over time for both groups. Early guideline-concordant follow-up care did not appear to substantially influence eGFR or hospitalization rates over the longer term. We were unable to confirm whether the lack of physician visits or laboratory data in certain donors was due to physician or patient decisions. Although policies directed toward improving early donor follow-up may encourage continued follow-up, additional strategies may be necessary to mitigate long-term donor risks. Les lignes directrices actuelles recommandent que les donneurs de rein vivants soient suivis annuellement, et ce, &#xe0; vie, afin de surveiller leur sant&#xe9; r&#xe9;nale. Aux &#xc9;tats-Unis, la d&#xe9;claration des donn&#xe9;es cliniques et des donn&#xe9;es de laboratoire compl&#xe8;tes pour les donneurs de rein est exig&#xe9;e pour les deux premi&#xe8;res ann&#xe9;es suivant le don. On ignore cependant les r&#xe9;percussions &#xe0; long terme pour ceux qui re&#xe7;oivent des soins pr&#xe9;coces conformes aux lignes directrices. Le principal objectif de cette &#xe9;tude &#xe9;tait de comparer les soins de suivi post-don &#xe0; long terme et les r&#xe9;sultats cliniques des donneurs de rein vivants, selon qu&#x2019;ils avaient re&#xe7;u ou non des soins de suivi pr&#xe9;coces conformes aux recommandations. &#xc9;tude de cohorte r&#xe9;trospective bas&#xe9;e sur une population. Les banques de donn&#xe9;es coupl&#xe9;es du syst&#xe8;me de sant&#xe9; ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; utilis&#xe9;es pour identifier les donneurs de rein de l&#x2019;Alberta (Canada). L&#x2019;&#xe9;tude porte sur 460 donneurs de rein vivants ayant subi leur n&#xe9;phrectomie entre 2002 et 2013. Le principal crit&#xe8;re d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation &#xe9;tait un suivi annuel continu &#xe0; 5 et &#xe0; 10 ans post-don (rapport de cotes corrig&#xe9; avec intervalle de confiance de 95 % [<sub>LIC</sub>RRc<sub>LSC</sub>]). Les r&#xe9;sultats secondaires comprenaient la variation moyenne du d&#xe9;bit de filtration glom&#xe9;rulaire estim&#xe9; (DFGe) au fil du temps et les taux d&#x2019;hospitalisation toutes causes confondues. Nous avons compar&#xe9; le suivi &#xe0; long terme et les r&#xe9;sultats cliniques de donneurs qui avaient re&#xe7;u ou non des soins pr&#xe9;coces conformes aux directives, d&#xe9;finis par une visite annuelle chez le m&#xe9;decin et des mesures de la cr&#xe9;atinine s&#xe9;rique et de l&#x2019;albuminurie pour les deux premi&#xe8;res ann&#xe9;es post-don. Des 460 donneurs inclus &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude, 187 (41 %) disposaient de preuves de suivi conformes aux directives, soit de donn&#xe9;es cliniques et de laboratoire, pour les deux premi&#xe8;res ann&#xe9;es post-don. Les chances d&#x2019;avoir un suivi annuel pour les donneurs qui n&#x2019;avaient pas re&#xe7;u de soins pr&#xe9;coces conformes aux directives &#xe9;taient de 76 % inf&#xe9;rieures &#xe0; 5 ans (RRc: <sub>0,18</sub>0,24<sub>0,32</sub>) et de 68 % inf&#xe9;rieures &#xe0; 10 ans (RRc: <sub>0,23</sub>0,32<sub>0,46</sub>) par rapport aux donneurs qui en avaient re&#xe7;u. Les chances de poursuivre le suivi sont demeur&#xe9;es stables au fil du temps pour les deux groupes. Le fait d&#x2019;avoir re&#xe7;u des soins de suivi pr&#xe9;coces conformes aux recommandations ne semble pas avoir eu d&#x2019;incidence importante sur les mesures de DFGe ou les taux d&#x2019;hospitalisation &#xe0; long terme.

      "abstract": "Denosumab can be used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but has been linked with cases of severe hypocalcemia. The incidence of and risk factors for hypocalcemia after denosumab use are not well established. Using linked health care databases at ICES, we conducted a population-based cohort study of adults &gt;65&#x2009;years old with a new prescription for denosumab or a bisphosphonate between 2012 and 2020. We assessed incidence of hypocalcemia within 180&#x2009;days of drug dispensing and stratified results by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR in mL/min/1.73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup> ). We used Cox proportional hazards to assess risk factors for hypocalcemia. There were 59,151 and 56,847 new denosumab and oral bisphosphonate users, respectively. Of the denosumab users, 29% had serum calcium measured in the year before their prescription, and one-third had their serum calcium checked within 180&#x2009;days after their prescription. Mild hypocalcemia (albumin corrected calcium &lt;2.00&#x2009;mmol/L) occurred in 0.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 0.7) of new denosumab users and severe hypocalcemia (&lt;1.8&#x2009;mmol/L) in 0.2% (95% CI 0.2, 0.3). In those with an eGFR &lt;15 or receiving maintenance dialysis, the incidence of mild and severe hypocalcemia was 24.1% (95% CI 18.1, 30.7) and 14.9% (95% CI 10.1, 20.7), respectively. In this group, kidney function and baseline serum calcium were strong predictors of hypocalcemia. We did not have information on over-the-counter vitamin D or calcium supplementation. In new bisphosphonate users, the incidence of mild hypocalcemia was 0.3% (95% CI 0.3, 0.3) with an incidence of 4.7% (95% CI 1.5, 10.8) in those with an eGFR &lt;15 or receiving maintenance dialysis. In this large population-based cohort, we found that the overall risk of hypocalcemia with new denosumab use was low but increased substantially in those with eGFR &lt;15&#x2009;mL/min/1.73&#x2009;m<sup>2</sup> . Future studies should investigate strategies to mitigate hypocalcemia. &#xa9; 2023 The Authors.

      "abstract": "AKI is a heterogeneous syndrome. Current subphenotyping approaches have only used limited laboratory data to understand a much more complex condition. We focused on patients with AKI from the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae in AKI (ASSESS-AKI). We used hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage on biomarkers of inflammation, injury, and repair/health. We then evaluated clinical differences between subphenotypes and examined their associations with cardiorenal events and death using Cox proportional hazard models. We included 748 patients with AKI: 543 (73%) of them had AKI stage 1, 112 (15%) had AKI stage 2, and 93 (12%) had AKI stage 3. The mean age (&#xb1;SD) was 64 (13) years; 508 (68%) were men; and the median follow-up was 4.7 (Q1: 2.9, Q3: 5.7) years. Patients with AKI subphenotype 1 ( N =181) had the highest kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) and troponin T levels. Subphenotype 2 ( N =250) had the highest levels of uromodulin. AKI subphenotype 3 ( N =159) comprised patients with markedly high pro-brain natriuretic peptide and plasma tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and -2 and low concentrations of KIM-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. Finally, patients with subphenotype 4 ( N =158) predominantly had sepsis-AKI and the highest levels of vascular/kidney inflammation (YKL-40, MCP-1) and injury (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, KIM-1). AKI subphenotypes 3 and 4 were independently associated with a higher risk of death compared with subphenotype 2 and had adjusted hazard ratios of 2.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 4.6) and 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 2.6, P = 0.04), respectively. Subphenotype 3 was also independently associated with a three-fold risk of CKD and cardiovascular events. We discovered four AKI subphenotypes with differing clinical features and biomarker profiles that are associated with longitudinal clinical outcomes.",

Patients may be cared for continuously by a single primary nephrologist or by a group of nephrologists on a rotating basis. It remains unclear whether these differing care models influence clinical outcomes. In this population-based cohort study of more than 14,000 incident patients on maintenance hemodialysis from Ontario, Canada, we found no difference in mortality, kidney transplantation, home dialysis initiation, hospitalizations, or emergency department visits when care was provided by a single primary nephrologist or a rotating group of nephrologists. These results suggest that primary nephrologist models do not necessarily improve objective clinical outcomes, providing reassurance to patients, providers, and administrators that both models are acceptable options.",

      "abstract": "The association between growth differentiation factor-15 concentrations and cardiovascular disease has been well described. The study hypothesis was that growth differentiation factor-15 may help cardiac risk stratification in noncardiac surgical patients, in addition to clinical evaluation. The objective of the study was to determine whether preoperative serum growth differentiation factor-15 is associated with the composite primary outcome of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery and vascular death at 30 days and can improve cardiac risk prediction in noncardiac surgery. This is a prospective cohort study of patients 45 yr or older having major noncardiac surgery. The association between preoperative growth differentiation factor-15 and the primary outcome was determined after adjusting for the Revised Cardiac Risk Index. Preoperative N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide was also added to compare predictive performance with growth differentiation factor-15. Between October 27, 2008, and October 30, 2013, a total of 5,238 patients were included who had preoperative growth differentiation factor-15 measured (median, 1,325; interquartile range, 880 to 2,132 pg/ml). The risk of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery and vascular death was 99 of 1,705 (5.8%) for growth differentiation factor-15 less than 1,000 pg/ml, 161 of 1,332 (12.1%) for growth differentiation factor-15 1,000 to less than 1,500 pg/ml, 302 of 1476 (20.5%) for growth differentiation factor-15 1,500 to less than 3,000 pg/ml, and 247 of 725 (34.1%) for growth differentiation factor-15 concentrations 3,000 pg/ml or greater. Compared to patients who had growth differentiation factor-15 concentrations less than 1,000 pg/ml, the corresponding adjusted hazard ratio for each growth differentiation factor-15 category was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.50 to 2.48), 3.04 (95% CI, 2.41 to 3.84), and 4.8 (95% CI, 3.76 to 6.14), respectively. The addition of growth differentiation factor-15 improved cardiac risk classification by 30.1% (301 per 1,000 patients) compared to Revised Cardiac Risk Index alone. It also provided additional risk classification beyond the combination of preoperative N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide and Revised Cardiac Risk Index (16.1%; 161 per 1,000 patients). Growth differentiation factor-15 is strongly associated with 30-day risk of major cardiovascular events and significantly improved cardiac risk prediction in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.",

      "abstract": "Administrative data are used in studies of hemodialysis care to report cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Showing recorded events are associated with significant health care resource use and poor outcomes would confirm that administrative data algorithms identify clinically meaningful events. The objective of this study was to describe the 30-day health service use and outcomes when a hospital admission with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or ischemic stroke is recorded in administrative databases. This is a retrospective review of linked administrative data. Patients receiving maintenance in-center hemodialysis in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, were included. Records from linked health care databases at ICES in Ontario, Canada were considered. We identified hospital admission with the most responsible diagnosis recorded as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or ischemic stroke. We then assessed the frequency of common tests, procedures, consultations, post-discharge outpatient drug prescriptions, and outcomes within 30 days following the hospital admission. We used descriptive statistics to summarize results using counts and percentages for categorical variables and means with standard deviations or medians with quartile ranges for continuous variables. There were 14&#x2009;368 patients who received maintenance hemodialysis between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017. The number of events per 1000 person-years was 33.5 for hospital admissions with myocardial infarction, 34.2 for congestive heart failure, and 12.9 for ischemic stroke. The median (25th, 75th percentile) duration of hospital stay was 5 (3-10) days for myocardial infarction, 4 (2-8) days for congestive heart failure, and 9 (4-18) days for ischemic stroke. The chance of death within 30 days was 21% for myocardial infarction, 11% for congestive heart failure, and 19% for ischemic stroke. Events, procedures, and tests recorded in administrative data can be misclassified compared with medical charts. In patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, hospital admissions of major cardiovascular events routinely recorded in health administrative databases are associated with significant use of health service resources and poor health outcomes.

      "abstract": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated mental health challenges among physicians and non-physicians. However, it is unclear if the worsening mental health among physicians is due to specific occupational stressors, reflective of general societal stressors during the pandemic, or a combination. We evaluated the difference in mental health and addictions health service use between physicians and non-physicians, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada between March 11, 2017 and August 11, 2021 using data collected from Ontario's universal health system. Physicians were identified using registrations with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario between 1990 and 2020. Participants included 41,814 physicians and 12,054,070 non-physicians. We compared the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020 to August 11, 2021) to the period before COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2017 to February 11, 2020). The primary outcome was mental health and addiction outpatient visits overall and subdivided into virtual versus in-person, psychiatrists versus family medicine and general practice clinicians. We used generalized estimating equations for the analyses. Pre-pandemic, after adjustment for age and sex, physicians had higher rates of psychiatry visits (aIRR 3.91 95% CI 3.55 to 4.30) and lower rates of family medicine visits (aIRR 0.62 95% CI 0.58 to 0.66) compared to non-physicians. During the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of outpatient mental health and addiction (MHA) visits increased by 23.2% in physicians (888.4 pre versus 1,094.7 during per 1,000 person-years, aIRR 1.39 95% CI 1.28 to 1.51) and 9.8% in non-physicians (615.5 pre versus 675.9 during per 1,000 person-years, aIRR 1.12 95% CI 1.09 to 1.14). Outpatient MHA and virtual care visits increased more among physicians than non-physicians during the first 18 months of the pandemic. Limitations include residual confounding between physician and non-physicians and challenges differentiating whether observed increases in MHA visits during the pandemic are due to stressors or changes in health care access. The first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a larger increase in outpatient MHA visits in physicians than non-physicians. These findings suggest physicians may have had larger negative mental health during COVID-19 than the general population and highlight the need for increased access to mental health services and system level changes to promote physician wellness.",

      "abstract": "For patients who initiate dialysis during a hospital admission and continue to require dialysis after discharge, outpatient dialysis management could be improved by better understanding the future likelihood of recovery to dialysis independence and the competing risk of death. We derived and validated linked models to predict the subsequent recovery to dialysis independence and death within 1 year of hospital discharge using a population-based cohort of 7657 patients in Ontario, Canada. Predictive variables included age, comorbidities, length of hospital admission, intensive care status, discharge disposition, and prehospital admission eGFR and random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Models were externally validated in 1503 contemporaneous patients from Alberta, Canada. Both models were created using proportional hazards survival analysis, with the \"Recovery Model\" using Fine-Gray methods. Probabilities generated from both models were used to develop 16 distinct \"Recovery and Death in Outpatients\" (ReDO) risk groups. ReDO risk groups in the derivation group had significantly distinct 1-year probabilities for recovery to dialysis independence (first quartile: 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 9% to 11%]; fourth quartile: 73% [70% to 77%]) and for death (first quartile: 12% [11% to 13%]; fourth quartile: 46% [43% to 50%]). In the validation group, model discrimination was modest (c-statistics [95% CI] for recovery and for death quartiles were 0.70 [0.67 to 0.73] and 0.66 [0.62 to 0.69], respectively), but calibration was excellent (integrated calibration index [95% CI] was 7% [5% to 9%] and 4% [2% to 6%] for recovery and death, respectively). The ReDO models generated accurate expected probabilities of recovery to dialysis independence and death in patients who continued outpatient dialysis after initiating dialysis in hospital.

      "abstract": "Among patients having noncardiac surgery, perioperative hemodynamic abnormalities are associated with vascular complications. Uncertainty remains about what intraoperative blood pressure to target and how to manage long-term antihypertensive medications perioperatively. To compare the effects of a hypotension-avoidance and a hypertension-avoidance strategy on major vascular complications after noncardiac surgery. Partial factorial randomized trial of 2 perioperative blood pressure management strategies (reported here) and tranexamic acid versus placebo. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03505723). 110 hospitals in 22 countries. 7490 patients having noncardiac surgery who were at risk for vascular complications and were receiving 1 or more long-term antihypertensive medications. In the hypotension-avoidance strategy group, the intraoperative mean arterial pressure target was 80&#x2009;mm Hg or greater; before and for 2&#x2009;days after surgery, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors were withheld and the other long-term antihypertensive medications were administered only for systolic blood pressures 130&#x2009;mm Hg or greater, following an algorithm. In the hypertension-avoidance strategy group, the intraoperative mean arterial pressure target was 60&#x2009;mm Hg or greater; all antihypertensive medications were continued before and after surgery. The primary outcome was a composite of vascular death and nonfatal myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, stroke, and cardiac arrest at 30&#x2009;days. Outcome adjudicators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome occurred in 520 of 3742 patients (13.9%) in the hypotension-avoidance group and in 524 of 3748 patients (14.0%) in the hypertension-avoidance group (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.12]; <i>P</i>&#xa0;=&#x2009;0.92). Results were consistent for patients who used 1 or more than 1 antihypertensive medication in the long term. Adherence to the assigned strategies was suboptimal; however, results were consistent across different adherence levels. In patients having noncardiac surgery, our hypotension-avoidance and hypertension-avoidance strategies resulted in a similar incidence of major vascular complications.

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with varying causes, pathophysiology, and outcomes. We incorporated plasma and urine biomarker measurements to identify AKI subgroups (subphenotypes) more tightly linked to underlying pathophysiology and long-term clinical outcomes. Multicenter cohort study. 769 hospitalized adults with AKI matched with 769 without AKI, enrolled from December 2009 to February 2015 in the ASSESS-AKI Study. 29 clinical, plasma, and urinary biomarker parameters used to identify AKI subphenotypes. Composite of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) with a median follow-up period of 4.7 years. Latent class analysis (LCA) and k-means clustering were applied to 29 clinical, plasma, and urinary biomarker parameters. Associations between AKI subphenotypes and MAKE were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Among 769 AKI patients both LCA and k-means identified 2 distinct AKI subphenotypes (classes 1 and 2). The long-term risk for MAKE was higher with class 2 (adjusted HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08-1.84]; P=0.01) compared with class 1, adjusting for demographics, hospital level factors, and KDIGO stage of AKI. The higher risk of MAKE among class 2 was explained by a higher risk of long-term chronic kidney disease progression and dialysis. The top variables that were different between classes 1 and 2 included plasma and urinary biomarkers of inflammation and epithelial cell injury; serum creatinine ranked 20th out of the 29 variables for differentiating classes. A replication cohort with simultaneously collected blood and urine sampling in hospitalized adults with AKI and long-term outcomes was unavailable. We identify 2 molecularly distinct AKI subphenotypes with differing risk of long-term outcomes, independent of the current criteria to risk stratify AKI. Future identification of AKI subphenotypes may facilitate linking therapies to underlying pathophysiology to prevent long-term sequalae after AKI. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs commonly in hospitalized patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The AKI definition lumps many different types of AKI together, but subgroups of AKI may be more tightly linked to the underlying biology and clinical outcomes. We used 29 different clinical, blood, and urinary biomarkers and applied 2 different statistical algorithms to identify AKI subtypes and their association with long-term outcomes. Both clustering algorithms identified 2 AKI subtypes with different risk of chronic kidney disease, independent of the serum creatinine concentrations (the current gold standard to determine severity of AKI). Identification of AKI subtypes may facilitate linking therapies to underlying biology to prevent long-term consequences after AKI.",

      "abstract": "Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart arrhythmia in the elderly population. AF patients are at high-risk of ischemic strokes, but oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy reduces such risks. Warfarin had been the standard OAC for AF patients, however its effectiveness is highly variable and dependent on close monitoring of the anticoagulant response. Newer OACs such as rivaroxaban and apixaban address these drawbacks but are more costly. It is uncertain which OAC therapy for AF is cost-saving from the healthcare system perspective. We followed a cohort of patients in Ontario, Canada, aged&#x2009;&#x2265;&#x2009;66 who were newly diagnosed with AF and prescribed OACs between 2012 and 2017. We used a two-stage estimation procedure. First, we account for the patient selection into OACs using a multinomial logit regression model and estimated propensity scores. Second, we used an inverse probability weighted regression adjustment approach to determine cost-saving OAC options. We also examined component-specific costs (i.e., drug, hospitalization, emergency department and physician) to understand the drivers of cost-saving OACs. We found that compared to warfarin, rivaroxaban and apixaban treatments were cost-saving options, with per-patient 1-year healthcare cost savings at $2436 and $1764, respectively. These savings were driven by cost-savings in hospitalization, emergency department visits, and physician visits, outweighing higher drug costs. These results were robust to alternative model specifications and estimation procedures. Treating AF patients with rivaroxaban and apixaban than warfarin reduces healthcare costs. OAC reimbursement policies for AF patients should consider rivaroxaban or apixaban over warfarin as the first-line treatment.",

DISP1 and TLR5 were differentially regulated in kidney biopsy tissue from patients with AKI compared with no AKI. Although common genetic risks for CKD are well established, genetic factors influencing risk for AKI in hospitalized patients are poorly understood. We conducted a genome-wide association study in 1369 participants in the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of AKI Study; a multiethnic population of hospitalized participants with and without AKI matched on demographics, comorbidities, and kidney function before hospitalization. We then completed functional annotation of top-performing variants for AKI using single-cell RNA sequencing data from kidney biopsies in 12 patients with AKI and 18 healthy living donors from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project. No genome-wide significant associations with AKI risk were found in Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of AKI (<i>P &lt; 5&#xd7;10</i><sup><i>&#x2212;8</i></sup>). The top two variants with the strongest association with AKI mapped to the <i>dispatched resistance-nodulation-division (RND) transporter family member 1 (DISP1)</i> gene and <i>toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5)</i> gene locus, rs17538288 (odds ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 182; <i>P = 9.47&#xd7;10</i><sup><i>&#x2212;8</i></sup>) and rs7546189 (odds ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 1.81; <i>P = 4.60&#xd7;10</i><sup><i>&#x2212;7</i></sup>).

AKI is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with various underlying risk factors, etiologies, and pathophysiology that may limit the identification of genetic variants.

      "abstract": "Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic predominantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme. We studied the risk of adverse events following coprescription of clarithromycin (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) versus azithromycin (not a CYP3A4 inhibitor) in quetiapine users. This was a population-based retrospective cohort study from 2004 to 2020 in Ontario, Canada in adult quetiapine users newly co-prescribed clarithromycin (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;16,909) or azithromycin (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;25,267). The primary outcome was the composite of hospital encounters with encephalopathy (defined as a diagnosis of delirium, disorientation, transient alteration of awareness, transient ischemic attack, or unspecified dementia), a fall, or a fracture within 30 days of new coprescription. Secondary outcomes were individual components of the composite outcome, hospital encounter with computed tomography&#xa0;(CT) head scan, and all-cause mortality. Coprescription of clarithromycin versus azithromycin with quetiapine was associated with a higher risk of the primary composite outcome (365 of 16,909 clarithromycin users [2.2%] vs. 309 of 16,929 azithromycin users [1.8%]; absolute risk increase, 0.34% [95% confidence interval,&#xa0;CI, 0.04-0.63]; relative risk [RR], 1.19 [95% CI,&#xa0;1.02-1.38]). This was primarily driven by an increase in fragility fractures (78 of 16,909 clarithromycin users [0.5%] vs. 45 of 16,923 azithromycin users [0.3%]; absolute risk increase, 0.20% [95% CI, 0.07-0.32]; RR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.21-2.52]). Hospital encounters with a CT head scan were higher in clarithromycin users (220 of 16,909 [1.3%] vs. 175 of 16,923 azithromycin users [1.0%]; absolute risk increase, 0.27% [95% CI, 0.04-0.50]; RR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.04-1.54]), but there was no difference in hospital encounters with encephalopathy, falls, or all-cause mortality between macrolide groups. Among adults taking quetiapine, concurrent use of clarithromycin compared with azithromycin was associated with a small but statistically greater 30-day risk of a hospital encounter for encephalopathy, falls, or fracture, which was predominantly related to a higher rate of fragility fractures.",

      "abstract": "Eligible patients with kidney failure should have equal access to kidney transplantation. Transplant referral is the first crucial step toward receiving a kidney transplant; however, studies suggest substantial variation in the rate of kidney transplant referral across regions. The province of Ontario, Canada, has a public, single-payer health care system with 27 regional chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs. The probability of being referred for kidney transplant may not be equal across CKD programs. To determine whether there is variability in kidney transplant referral rates across Ontario's CKD programs. Population-based cohort study using linked administrative health care databases from January 1, 2013, to November 1, 2016. Twenty-seven regional CKD programs in the province of Ontario, Canada. Patients approaching the need for dialysis (advanced CKD) and patients receiving maintenance dialysis (maximum follow-up: November 1, 2017). Kidney transplant referral. We calculated the 1-year unadjusted cumulative probability of kidney transplant referral for Ontario's 27 CKD programs using the complement of Kaplan-Meier estimator. We calculated standardized referral ratios (SRRs) for each CKD program, using expected referrals from a 2-staged Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for patient characteristics in the first stage. Standardized referral ratios with a value less than 1 were below the provincial average (maximum possible follow-up of 4 years 10 months). In an additional analysis, we grouped CKD programs according to 5 geographic regions. Among 8641 patients with advanced CKD, the 1-year cumulative probability of kidney transplant referral ranged from 0.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2%-3.7%) to 21.0% (95% CI: 17.5%-25.2%) across the 27 CKD programs. The adjusted SRR ranged from 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.4) to 4.2 (95% CI: 2.1-7.5). Among 6852 patients receiving maintenance dialysis, the 1-year cumulative probability of transplant referral ranged from 6.4% (95% CI: 4.0%-10.2%) to 34.5% (95% CI: 29.5%-40.1%) across CKD programs. The adjusted SRR ranged from 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.3) to 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6-2.1). When we grouped CKD programs according to geographic region, we found that patients residing in Northern regions had a substantially lower 1-year cumulative probability of transplant referral. Our cumulative probability estimates only captured referrals within the first year of advanced CKD or maintenance dialysis initiation. There is marked variability in the probability of kidney transplant referral across CKD programs operating in a publicly funded health care system.

      "abstract": "Inflammation during and after surgery can lead to organ damage including acute kidney injury. Colchicine, an established inexpensive anti-inflammatory medication, may help to protect the organs from pro-inflammatory damage. This protocol describes a kidney substudy of the colchicine for the prevention of perioperative atrial fibrillation (COP-AF) study, which is testing the effect of colchicine versus placebo on the risk of atrial fibrillation and myocardial injury among patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Our kidney substudy of COP-AF will determine whether colchicine reduces the risk of perioperative acute kidney injury compared with a placebo. We will also examine whether colchicine has a larger absolute benefit in patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease, the most prominent risk factor for acute kidney injury. Randomized, superiority clinical trial conducted in 40 centers in 11 countries from 2018 to 2023. Patients (~3200) aged 55 years and older having major thoracic surgery. Patients are randomized 1:1 to receive oral colchicine (0.5 mg tablet) or a matching placebo, given twice daily starting 2 to 4 hours before surgery for a total of 10 days. Patients, health care providers, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators will be blinded to the randomized treatment allocation. Serum creatinine concentrations will be measured before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 (or until hospital discharge). The primary outcome of the substudy is perioperative acute kidney injury, defined as an increase (from the prerandomization value) in serum creatinine concentration of either &#x2265;26.5 &#x3bc;mol/L (&#x2265;0.3 mg/dL) within 48 hours of surgery or &#x2265;50% within 7 days of surgery. The primary analysis (intention-to-treat) will examine the relative risk of acute kidney injury in patients allocated to receive colchicine versus placebo. We will repeat the primary analysis using alternative definitions of acute kidney injury and examine effect modification by pre-existing chronic kidney disease, defined as a prerandomization estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The substudy will be underpowered to detect small effects on more severe forms of acute kidney injury treated with dialysis. Substudy results will be reported in 2024. This substudy will estimate the effect of colchicine on the risk of perioperative acute kidney injury in older adults undergoing major thoracic surgery. NCT03310125. L&#x2019;inflammation pendant et apr&#xe8;s une intervention chirurgicale peut causer des l&#xe9;sions aux organes, notamment de l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale aigu&#xeb; (IRA).

We compared rivaroxaban with warfarin across the range of kidney function in adults with AF. Multicenter retrospective cohort. Adults with AF and a measure of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); using administrative data from 5 jurisdictions across Australia and Canada (2011-2018). Kidney function was categorized as eGFR&#xa0;&#x2265;60, 45-59, 30-44, and&#xa0;&lt;30&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup>. Patients receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients were excluded. New dispensation of either rivaroxaban or warfarin. Composite (1) effectiveness outcome (all-cause death, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack) and (2) major bleeding events (intracranial, gastrointestinal, or other) at 1 year. Cox proportional hazards models accounting for propensity score matching were performed independently in each jurisdiction and then pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. 55,568 patients (27,784 rivaroxaban-warfarin user matched pairs; mean age 74 years, 46% female, 33.5% with eGFR&#xa0;&lt;60&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup>) experienced a total of 4,733 (8.5%) effectiveness and 1,144 (2.0%) bleeding events. Compared to warfarin, rivaroxaban was associated with greater or similar effectiveness across a broad range of kidney function (pooled HRs of 0.72 [95% CI, 0.66-0.78], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.58-1.06], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57-0.87], and 0.78 [95% CI, 0.62-0.99]) for eGFR&#xa0;&#x2265;60, 45-59, 30-44, and&#xa0;&lt;30&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Rivaroxaban was also associated with similar risk of major bleeding across all eGFR categories (pooled HRs of 0.75 [95% CI, 0.56-1.00], 1.01 [95% CI, 0.79-1.30], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.66-1.15], and 0.63 [95% CI, 0.37-1.09], respectively). Unmeasured treatment selection bias and residual confounding. In adults with AF, rivaroxaban compared with warfarin was associated with lower or similar risk of all-cause death, ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack and similar risk of bleeding across a broad range of kidney function. This real-world study involved a large cohort of 55,568 adults with atrial fibrillation from 5 jurisdictions across Australia and Canada. It showed that the favorable safety (bleeding) and effectiveness (stroke or death) profile of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin was consistent across different levels of kidney function. This study adds important safety data on the use of rivaroxaban in patients with reduced kidney function, including those with estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xa0;&lt;30&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup> in whom the risks and benefits of rivaroxaban use is most uncertain. Overall, the study supports the use of rivaroxaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for atrial fibrillation across differing levels of kidney function.",

      "abstract": "Biomarkers of tubular function such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) may improve prognostication of participants at highest risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) after hospitalization. To examine this, we measured urinary EGF (uEGF) from samples collected in the Assessment, Serial Evaluation, and Subsequent Sequelae of Acute Kidney Injury (ASSESS-AKI) Study, a multi-center, prospective, observational cohort of hospitalized participants with and without AKI. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate the association of uEGF/Cr at hospitalization, three months post-discharge, and the change between these time points with major adverse kidney events (MAKE): CKD incidence, progression, or development of kidney failure. Clinical findings were paired with mechanistic studies comparing relative Egf expression in mouse models of kidney atrophy or repair after ischemia-reperfusion injury. MAKE was observed in 20% of 1,509 participants over 4.3 years of follow-up. Each 2-fold higher level of uEGF/Cr at three months was associated with decreased risk of MAKE (adjusted hazards ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.55). Participants with the highest increase in uEGF/Cr from hospitalization to three-month follow-up had a lower risk of MAKE (adjusted hazards ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.74) compared to those with the least change in uEGF/Cr. A model using uEGF/Cr at three months combined with clinical variables yielded moderate discrimination for MAKE (area under the curve 0.73; 95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.77) and strong discrimination for kidney failure at four years (area under the curve 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.92-1.00). Accelerated restoration of Egf expression in mice was seen in the model of adaptive repair after injury, compared to a model of progressive atrophy. Thus, urinary EGF/Cr may be a biomarker of distal tubular health, with higher concentrations and increased uEGF/Cr post-discharge independently associated with reduced risk of MAKE in hospitalized patients.",

      "abstract": "In previous analyses, myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, major bleeding, and sepsis were independently associated with most deaths in the 30 days after noncardiac surgery, but most of these deaths occurred during the index hospitalization for surgery. The authors set out to describe outcomes after discharge from hospital up to 1 yr after inpatient noncardiac surgery and associations between predischarge complications and postdischarge death up to 1 yr after surgery. This study was an analysis of patients discharged after inpatient noncardiac surgery in a large international prospective cohort study across 28 centers from 2007 to 2013 of patients aged 45 yr or older followed to 1 yr after surgery. The study estimated (1) the cumulative postdischarge incidence of death and other outcomes up to a year after surgery and (2) the adjusted time-varying associations between postdischarge death and predischarge complications including myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, major bleeding, sepsis, infection without sepsis, stroke, congestive heart failure, clinically important atrial fibrillation or flutter, amputation, venous thromboembolism, and acute kidney injury managed with dialysis. Among 38,898 patients discharged after surgery, the cumulative 1-yr incidence was 5.8% (95% CI, 5.5 to 6.0%) for all-cause death and 24.7% (95% CI, 24.2 to 25.1%) for all-cause hospital readmission. Predischarge complications were associated with 33.7% (95% CI, 27.2 to 40.2%) of deaths up to 30 days after discharge and 15.0% (95% CI, 12.0 to 17.9%) up to 1 yr. Most of the association with death was due to myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (15.6% [95% CI, 9.3 to 21.9%] of deaths within 30 days, 6.4% [95% CI, 4.1 to 8.7%] within 1 yr), major bleeding (15.0% [95% CI, 8.3 to 21.7%] within 30 days, 4.7% [95% CI, 2.2 to 7.2%] within 1 yr), and sepsis (5.4% [95% CI, 2.2 to 8.6%] within 30 days, 2.1% [95% CI, 1.0 to 3.1%] within 1 yr). One in 18 patients 45 yr old or older discharged after inpatient noncardiac surgery died within 1 yr, and one quarter were readmitted to the hospital. The risk of death associated with predischarge perioperative complications persists for weeks to months after discharge.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (low estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] or albuminuria) affects approximately 14% of adults in the US. To evaluate associations of lower eGFR based on creatinine alone, lower eGFR based on creatinine combined with cystatin C, and more severe albuminuria with adverse kidney outcomes, cardiovascular outcomes, and other health outcomes. Individual-participant data meta-analysis of 27&#x202f;503&#x202f;140 individuals from 114 global cohorts (eGFR based on creatinine alone) and 720&#x202f;736 individuals from 20 cohorts (eGFR based on creatinine and cystatin C) and 9&#x202f;067&#x202f;753 individuals from 114 cohorts (albuminuria) from 1980 to 2021. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration 2021 equations for eGFR based on creatinine alone and eGFR based on creatinine and cystatin C; and albuminuria estimated as urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). The risk of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, acute kidney injury, any hospitalization, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and peripheral artery disease. The analyses were performed within each cohort and summarized with random-effects meta-analyses. Within the population using eGFR based on creatinine alone (mean age, 54 years [SD, 17 years]; 51% were women; mean follow-up time, 4.8 years [SD, 3.3 years]), the mean eGFR was 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD, 22 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the median UACR was 11 mg/g (IQR, 8-16 mg/g). Within the population using eGFR based on creatinine and cystatin C (mean age, 59 years [SD, 12 years]; 53% were women; mean follow-up time, 10.8 years [SD, 4.1 years]), the mean eGFR was 88 mL/min/1.73 m2 (SD, 22 mL/min/1.73 m2) and the median UACR was 9 mg/g (IQR, 6-18 mg/g). Lower eGFR (whether based on creatinine alone or based on creatinine and cystatin C) and higher UACR were each significantly associated with higher risk for each of the 10 adverse outcomes, including those in the mildest categories of chronic kidney disease. For example, among people with a UACR less than 10 mg/g, an eGFR of 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on creatinine alone was associated with significantly higher hospitalization rates compared with an eGFR of 90 to 104 mL/min/1.73 m2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.3]; 161 vs 79 events per 1000 person-years; excess absolute risk, 22 events per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 19-25 events per 1000 person-years]). In this retrospective analysis of 114 cohorts, lower eGFR based on creatinine alone, lower eGFR based on creatinine and cystatin C, and more severe UACR were each associated with increased rates of 10 adverse outcomes, including adverse kidney outcomes, cardiovascular diseases, and hospitalizations.",

      "abstract": "Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have the best chance for a longer and healthier life if they receive a kidney transplant. However, many barriers prevent patients from receiving a transplant. To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent intervention designed to target several barriers that prevent eligible patients from completing key steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. This pragmatic, 2-arm, parallel-group, open-label, registry-based, superiority, cluster randomized clinical trial included all 26 CKD programs in Ontario, Canada, from November 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021. These programs provide care for patients with advanced CKD (patients approaching the need for dialysis or receiving maintenance dialysis). Using stratified, covariate-constrained randomization, allocation of the CKD programs at a 1:1 ratio was used to compare the multicomponent intervention vs usual care for 4.2 years. The intervention had 4 main components, (1) administrative support to establish local quality improvement teams; (2) transplant educational resources; (3) an initiative for transplant recipients and living donors to share stories and experiences; and (4) program-level performance reports and oversight by administrative leaders. The primary outcome was the rate of steps completed toward receiving a kidney transplant. Each patient could complete up to 4 steps: step 1, referred to a transplant center for evaluation; step 2, had a potential living donor contact a transplant center for evaluation; step 3, added to the deceased donor waitlist; and step 4, received a transplant from a living or deceased donor. The 26 CKD programs (13 intervention, 13 usual care) during the trial period included 20&#x202f;375 potentially transplant-eligible patients with advanced CKD (intervention group [n&#x2009;=&#x2009;9780 patients], usual-care group [n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10&#x202f;595 patients]). Despite evidence of intervention uptake, the step completion rate did not significantly differ between the intervention vs usual-care groups: 5334 vs 5638 steps; 24.8 vs 24.1 steps per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.87-1.15). This novel multicomponent intervention did not significantly increase the rate of completed steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. Improving access to transplantation remains a global priority that requires substantial effort. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03329521.",

      "abstract": "Low-dose methotrexate is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Due to its kidney elimination, better evidence is needed to inform its safety in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD). To compare the 90-day risk of serious adverse events among adults with CKD who started low-dose methotrexate vs those who started hydroxychloroquine and to compare the risk of serious adverse events among adults with CKD starting 2 distinct doses of methotrexate vs those starting hydroxychloroquine. This retrospective, population-based, new-user cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada (2008-2021) using linked administrative health care data. Adults aged 66 years or older with CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 but not receiving dialysis) who started low-dose methotrexate (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;2309) were matched 1:1 with those who started hydroxychloroquine. Low-dose methotrexate (5-35 mg/wk) vs hydroxychloroquine (200-400 mg/d). The primary outcome was a composite of serious adverse events: a hospital visit with myelosuppression, sepsis, pneumotoxic effects, or hepatotoxic effects within 90 days of starting the study drug. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted by eGFR category. Propensity score matching was used to balance comparison groups on indicators of baseline health. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using modified Poisson regression, and risk differences (RDs) using binomial regression. In a propensity score-matched cohort of 4618 adults with CKD (3192 [69%] women; median [IQR] age, 76 [71-82] years), the primary outcome was higher in patients who started low-dose methotrexate vs those who started hydroxychloroquine (82 of 2309 [3.55%] vs 40 of 2309 [1.73%]; RR, 2.05 (95% CI, 1.42-2.96); RD, 1.82% [95% CI, 0.91%-2.73%]). In subgroup analysis, the risks increased progressively at lower eGFR (eg, eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m2: RR, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.51-5.13]). In the secondary comparison with hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate users at 15 to 35 mg/wk had a higher risk of the primary outcome. In this cohort of 4618 older patients with CKD, the 90-day risk of serious adverse events was higher among those who started low-dose methotrexate than those who started hydroxychloroquine. If verified, these risks should be balanced against the benefits of low-dose methotrexate use.",

      "abstract": "Mental health problems, particularly anxiety and depression, are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and negatively impact quality of life, treatment adherence and mortality. However, the degree to which mental health and addiction services are utilized by those with CKD is unknown. We examined the history of mental health and addiction service use of individuals across levels of kidney function. We performed a population-based cross-sectional study using linked healthcare databases from Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2017. We abstracted the prevalence of individuals with mental health and addiction service use within the previous 3&#xa0;years across levels of kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x2265;60, 45 to &lt;60, 30 to &lt;45, 15 to &lt;30, &lt;15&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2 and maintenance dialysis]. We calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) to compare prevalence across kidney function strata, while adjusting for age, sex, year of cohort entry, urban versus rural location, area-level marginalization and Charlson comorbidity index. Of 5&#xa0;956&#xa0;589 adults, 9% (n&#xa0;=&#xa0;534&#xa0;605) had an eGFR &lt;60&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2 or were receiving maintenance dialysis. Fewer individuals with an eGFR &lt;60&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2 had a history of any mental health and addiction service utilization (crude prevalence range 28-31%) compared with individuals with an eGFR &#x2265;60&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2 (35%). Compared with an eGFR &#x2265;60&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2, the lowest prevalence of individuals with any mental health and addiction service utilization was among those with an eGFR of 15 to &lt;30&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2 {adjusted PR 0.86 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.88]}, an eGFR &lt;15&#xa0;ml/min/1.73&#xa0;m2 [adjusted PR 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.86)] and those receiving maintenance dialysis [adjusted PR 0.83 (95% CI 0.81-0.84)]. Less use of outpatient services accounted for differences in service utilization.

      "abstract": "Guidelines in Ontario, Canada, recommend timely referral for multidisciplinary kidney care to facilitate planned dialysis initiation. Many patients do not receive recommended multidisciplinary kidney care prior to dialysis. To better understand why this gap in pre-dialysis care exists, we conducted a study to describe the pathways by which patients initiate maintenance dialysis. A retrospective cohort study. Population-based, using health care administrative databases from Ontario, Canada. Adults initiating maintenance dialysis from April 2016 to March 2019. Patients were grouped based on whether they received recommended multidisciplinary kidney care prior to dialysis initiation (at least 1 year of care with at least 2 visits). For those who did not receive recommended care, we grouped patients as having no identified care gap or into the following groups: (1) lack of timely chronic kidney disease (CKD) screening, (2) late nephrology referral (&lt;1 year), or (3) late or no referral for multidisciplinary kidney care among patients followed by a nephrologist for at least 1 year. A total of 9216 patients were included with a mean (standard deviation) age of 66 (15) years, and 61.5% were male. Of the total, 896 (9.7%) patients died, 7671 (83.2%) remained on dialysis at 90 days, and 649 (7.0%) had stopped dialysis due to kidney function recovery within 90 days. Of the 9216 patients, 5434 (59%) had not received recommended multidisciplinary kidney care. Among those without recommended care, there were 2251 (41.4%) patients with no identified care gaps, 1351 (24.9%) patients with a lack of timely CKD screening, 359 (6.6%) patients with late nephrology referral, and 1473 (27.1%) patients with late or no referral for multidisciplinary kidney care. We could not determine if patients were referred but declined multidisciplinary kidney care. More than half of patients had not received recommended multidisciplinary kidney care. Many patients experienced an acute decline in kidney function, which may not be preventable, but in others, there were missed opportunities for CKD screening or early referral to nephrology, or at the level of nephrology practice for early referral for multidisciplinary care. This work could be used to inform policies aimed at improving increased uptake of multidisciplinary kidney care prior to dialysis. Les lignes directrices de l&#x2019;Ontario (Canada) recommandent que les patients soient dirig&#xe9;s en temps opportun vers une prise en charge multidisciplinaire de la maladie r&#xe9;nale afin de faciliter l&#x2019;initiation planifi&#xe9;e de la dialyze. Cette recommandation n&#x2019;est toutefois pas appliqu&#xe9;e pour de nombreux patients. Afin de mieux comprendre ce qui explique cette lacune dans les soins de pr&#xe9;dialyse, nous avons menu une &#xe9;tude visant &#xe0; d&#xe9;crire le parcours des patients jusqu&#x2019;&#xe0; l&#x2019;initiation de la dialyse chronique. &#xc9;tude de cohorte r&#xe9;trospective. &#xc9;tude populationnelle r&#xe9;alis&#xe9;e &#xe0; partir des bases de donn&#xe9;es administratives de sant&#xe9; de l&#x2019;Ontario (Canada).

      "abstract": "Safety issues are detected in about one third of prescription drugs in the years following regulatory agency approval. Older adults, especially those with chronic kidney disease, are at particular risk of adverse reactions to prescription drugs. This protocol describes a new approach that may identify credible drug-safety signals more efficiently using administrative health care data. To use high-throughput computing and automation to conduct 700+ drug-safety cohort studies in older adults in Ontario, Canada. Each study will compare 74 acute (30-day) outcomes in patients who start a new prescription drug (new users) to a group of nonusers with similar baseline health characteristics. Risks will be assessed within strata of baseline kidney function. The studies will be population-based, new-user cohort studies conducted using linked administrative health care databases in Ontario, Canada (January 1, 2008, to March 1, 2020). The source population for these studies will be residents of Ontario aged 66 years or older who filled at least one outpatient prescription through the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) program during the study period (all residents have universal health care, and those aged 65+ have universal prescription drug coverage through the ODB). We identified 3.2 million older adults in the source population during the study period and built 700+ initial medication cohorts, each containing mutually exclusive groups of new users and nonusers. Nonusers were randomly assigned cohort entry dates that followed the same distribution of prescription start dates as new users. Eligibility criteria included a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurement within 12 months before the cohort entry date (median time was 71 days before cohort entry in the new user group), no prior receipt of maintenance dialysis or a kidney transplant, and no prior prescriptions for drugs in the same subclass as the study drug. New users and nonusers will be balanced on ~400 baseline health characteristics using inverse probability of treatment weighting on propensity scores within 3 strata of baseline eGFR: &#x2265;60, 45 to &lt;60, &lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. We will compare new user and nonuser groups on 74 clinically relevant outcomes (17 composites and 57 individual outcomes) in the 30 days after cohort entry. We used a prespecified approach to identify these 74 outcomes. In each cohort, we will obtain eGFR-stratum-specific weighted risk ratios and risk differences using modified Poisson regression and binomial regression, respectively. Additive and multiplicative interaction by eGFR category will be examined. Drug-outcome associations that meet prespecified criteria (identified signals) will be further examined in additional analyses (including survival, negative-control exposure, and E-value analyses) and visualizations. The initial medication cohorts had a median of 6120 new users per cohort (interquartile range: 1469-38&#x2009;839) and a median of 1&#x2009;088&#x2009;301 nonusers (interquartile range: 751&#x2009;697-1&#x2009;267&#x2009;009). Medications with the largest number of new users were amoxicillin trihydrate (n = 1&#x2009;000&#x2009;032), cephalexin (n = 571&#x2009;566), prescription acetaminophen (n = 571&#x2009;563), and ciprofloxacin (n = 504,374); 19% to 29% of new users in these cohorts had an eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Despite our use of robust techniques to balance baseline indicators and to control for confounding by indication, residual confounding will remain a possibility. Only acute (30-day) outcomes will be examined. Our data sources do not include nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs or drugs prescribed in hospitals and do not include outpatient prescription drug use in children or adults &lt;65 years. This accelerated approach to conducting postmarket drug-safety studies has the potential to more efficiently detect drug-safety signals in a vulnerable population. The results of this protocol may ultimately help improve medication safety. Des probl&#xe8;mes d&#x2019;innocuit&#xe9; sont d&#xe9;tect&#xe9;s dans environ un tiers des m&#xe9;dicaments d&#x2019;ordonnance au cours des ann&#xe9;es qui suivent leur approbation par l&#x2019;organisme de r&#xe9;glementation. Les personnes &#xe2;g&#xe9;es, en particulier celles qui sont atteintes d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale chronique, sont particuli&#xe8;rement expos&#xe9;es aux effets ind&#xe9;sirables des m&#xe9;dicaments d&#x2019;ordonnance.

P&#xe9;riode &#xe9;tudi&#xe9;e: du 1<sup>er</sup> janvier 2008 au 1<sup>er</sup> mars 2020. Population source: les Ontariens de 66 ans ou plus ayant rempli au moins une ordonnance pour patient non hospitalis&#xe9; par l&#x2019;entremise du Program de m&#xe9;dicaments de l&#x2019;Ontario (PMO) pendant la p&#xe9;riode de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude (tous les r&#xe9;sidents de la province b&#xe9;n&#xe9;ficient d&#x2019;un syst&#xe8;me de soins de sant&#xe9; universel; les personnes &#xe2;g&#xe9;es de 65 ans et plus b&#xe9;n&#xe9;ficient d&#x2019;une couverture universelle des m&#xe9;dicaments d&#x2019;ordonnance par l&#x2019;interm&#xe9;diaire du PMO). Nous avons identifi&#xe9; 3,2 millions d&#x2019;adultes &#xe2;g&#xe9;s dans la population source au cours de la p&#xe9;riode d&#x2019;&#xe9;tude et constitu&#xe9; plus de 700 cohortes de m&#xe9;dicaments, chacune contenant des groupes mutuellement exclusifs de nouveaux utilisateurs et de non-utilisateurs. Les non-utilisateurs se sont vu attribuer au hasard des dates d&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte qui suivaient les dates de d&#xe9;but d&#x2019;ordonnance des nouveaux utilisateurs. Les crit&#xe8;res d&#x2019;admissibilit&#xe9; &#xe9;taient d&#x2019;avoir une mesure initiale du d&#xe9;bit de filtration glom&#xe9;rulaire estim&#xe9; [DFGe] dans les 12 mois pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;dant la date d&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte (dans le groupe des nouveaux utilisateurs, le d&#xe9;lai m&#xe9;dian &#xe9;tait de 71 jours avant l&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte), ne pas suivre de dialyze chronique, ne pas avoir eu de greffe r&#xe9;nale et n&#x2019;avoir jamais eu de prescription d&#x2019;un m&#xe9;dicament de la m&#xea;me sous-classe que le m&#xe9;dicament &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude. Les nouveaux utilisateurs et les non-utilisateurs seront jumel&#xe9;s selon environ 400 caract&#xe9;ristiques de sant&#xe9; initiales &#xe0; l&#x2019;aide de la probabilit&#xe9; inverse de traitement pond&#xe9;r&#xe9;e selon les scores de propension dans les trois strates de mesure du DFGe initial: &#x2265;60 ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup>; 45 &#xe0; &lt;60 ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup> et &lt;45 ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup>. Nous comparerons les groupes de nouveaux utilisateurs et de non-utilisateurs selon 74 crit&#xe8;res de jugement cliniquement pertinents (17 crit&#xe8;res composites et 57 crit&#xe8;res individuels) pendant les 30 jours suivant l&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte. Une approche pr&#xe9;d&#xe9;finie a permis de d&#xe9;terminer ces 74 r&#xe9;sultats. Dans chaque cohorte, nous calculerons les diff&#xe9;rences de risque (par r&#xe9;gression de Poisson) et les rapports de risque (par r&#xe9;gression binomiale) pond&#xe9;r&#xe9;s pour chaque strate de DFGe. Les interactions additives et multiplicatives par cat&#xe9;gorie de DFGe seront examin&#xe9;es. Les associations m&#xe9;dicaments-r&#xe9;sultats r&#xe9;pondant &#xe0; des crit&#xe8;res pr&#xe9;d&#xe9;finis (signaux identifi&#xe9;s) seront examin&#xe9;es plus avant dans des analyses suppl&#xe9;mentaires (survie, exposition &#xe0; des t&#xe9;moins n&#xe9;gatifs, analyses de la valeur E, etc.) et des visualizations. Dans les cohortes initiales de m&#xe9;dicaments, les m&#xe9;dianes sont de 6 120 nouveaux utilisateurs (intervalle interquartile de 1 469 &#xe0; 38 839) et de 1 088 301 non-utilisateurs (intervalle interquartile de 751 697 &#xe0; 1 267 009). Les m&#xe9;dicaments comptant le plus grand nombre de nouveaux utilisateurs sont le trihydrate d&#x2019;amoxicilline (n = 1 000 032), la c&#xe9;falexine (n = 571 566), l&#x2019;ac&#xe9;taminoph&#xe8;ne sur ordonnance (n = 571 563) et la ciprofloxacine (n = 504 374). De 19 &#xe0; 29 % des nouveaux utilisateurs dans ces cohortes pr&#xe9;sentaient un DFGe &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Malgr&#xe9; l&#x2019;utilization de techniques robustes pour &#xe9;quilibrer les indicateurs de base et pour contr&#xf4;ler le risque de confusion par indication, il pourrait subsister des facteurs de confusion r&#xe9;siduels. Seuls les r&#xe9;sultats aigus (30 jours) seront examin&#xe9;s. Nos sources de donn&#xe9;es ne comprennent pas les m&#xe9;dicaments sans ordonnance (en vente libre) ni les m&#xe9;dicaments prescrits dans les h&#xf4;pitaux, et n&#x2019;incluent pas l&#x2019;utilization de m&#xe9;dicaments sur ordonnance en ambulatoire chez les enfants ou les adultes de moins de 65 ans.

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the general population, but little is known about the incidence and risk factors associated with developing low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and moderate-severe albuminuria in living kidney donors following nephrectomy. Retrospective, population-based cohort study. Kidney donors in Alberta, Canada. Donor nephrectomy between May 2001 and December&#xa0;2017. Two eGFR measurements&#xa0;&lt;45&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup> or 2 measurements of moderate or severe albuminuria from 1-year postdonation onwards that were at least 90 days apart. Associations between potential risk factors and the primary outcome were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years (IQR, 4.7-12.6 years), 47 of 590 donors (8.0%) developed sustained low eGFR or moderate-severe albuminuria with an incidence rate of 9.2 per 1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 6.6-11.8). The median time for development of this outcome beyond the first year after nephrectomy was 2.9 years (IQR, 1.4-8.0 years). Within the first 4 years of follow-up, a 5&#xa0;mL/min/1.73&#xa0;m<sup>2</sup> lower predonation eGFR increased the hazard of developing postdonation low eGFR or moderate-severe albuminuria by 26% (adjusted HR,&#xa0;1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44). Furthermore, donors were at higher risk of developing low eGFR or albuminuria if they had evidence of predonation hypertension (adjusted HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.28-4.96) or postdonation diabetes (adjusted HR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.54-14.50). We lacked data on certain donor characteristics that may affect long-term kidney function, such as race, smoking history, and transplant-related characteristics. A proportion of kidney donors at an incidence rate of 9.2 per 1,000 person-years will develop low eGFR or albuminuria after donation. Donors with lower predonation eGFR, predonation hypertension, and postdonation diabetes are at increased risk of developing this outcome. The purpose of this study was to understand the risk of developing kidney disease in living kidney donors after donation. We followed 590 donors in Alberta, Canada for almost 9 years. Approximately 8% of donors developed reduced kidney function (low estimated glomerular filtration rate) or increased protein in the urine (albuminuria). Donors with lower kidney function before donation, hypertension before donation, or diabetes after donation had a higher likelihood of experiencing these kidney outcomes. This research provides important insights to patients and health care providers to better support the long-term kidney health of living kidney donors.",

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common after major abdominal surgery. Selection of candidate kidney protective strategies for testing in large trials should be based on robust preliminary evidence. A secondary analysis of the Restrictive versus Liberal Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial was conducted in adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery and randomly assigned to a restrictive or liberal perioperative fluid regimen. The primary outcome was maximum AKI stage before hospital discharge. Two multivariable ordinal regression models were developed to test the primary hypothesis that modifiable risk factors associated with increased maximum stage of postoperative AKI could be identified. Each model used a separate approach to variable selection to assess the sensitivity of the findings to modeling approach. For model 1, variable selection was informed by investigator opinion; for model 2, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique was used to develop a data-driven model from available variables. Of 2,444 patients analyzed, stage 1, 2, and 3 AKI occurred in 223 (9.1%), 59 (2.4%), and 36 (1.5%) patients, respectively. In multivariable modeling by model 1, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, intraoperatively only (odds ratio, 1.77 [99% CI, 1.11 to 2.82]), and preoperative day-of-surgery administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker compared to no regular use (odds ratio, 1.84 [99% CI, 1.15 to 2.94]) were associated with increased odds for greater maximum stage AKI. These results were unchanged in model 2, with the additional finding of an inverse association between nadir hemoglobin concentration on postoperative day 1 and greater maximum stage AKI. Avoiding intraoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors is a potential strategy to mitigate the risk for postoperative AKI. The findings strengthen the rationale for a clinical trial comprehensively testing the risk-benefit ratio of these drugs in the perioperative period.",

      "abstract": "Quality indicators in kidney transplants are needed to identify care gaps and improve access to transplants. We used linked administrative health care databases to examine multiple ways of defining pre-emptive living donor kidney transplants, including different patient cohorts and censoring definitions. We included adults from Ontario, Canada with advanced chronic kidney disease between January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2018. We created 4 unique incident patient cohorts, varying the eligibility by the risk of progression to kidney failure and whether individuals had a recorded contraindication to kidney transplant (eg, home oxygen use). We explored the effect of 4 censoring event definitions. Across the 4 cohorts, size varied substantially from 20 663 to 9598 patients, with the largest reduction (a 43% reduction) occurring when we excluded patients with &#x2265;1 recorded contraindication to kidney transplantation. The incidence rate (per 100 person-years) of pre-emptive living donor kidney transplant varied across cohorts from 1.02 (95% CI: 0.91-1.14) for our most inclusive cohort to 2.21 (95% CI: 1.96-2.49) for the most restrictive cohort.

      "abstract": "A key barrier to becoming a living kidney donor is an inefficient evaluation process, requiring more than 30 tests (eg, laboratory and diagnostic tests), questionnaires, and specialist consultations. Donor candidates make several trips to hospitals and clinics, and often spend months waiting for appointments and test results. The median evaluation time for a donor candidate in Ontario, Canada, is nearly 1 year. Longer wait times are associated with poorer outcomes for the kidney transplant recipient and higher health care costs. A shorter, more efficient donor evaluation process may help more patients with kidney failure receive a transplant, including a pre-emptive kidney transplant (ie, avoiding the need for dialysis). In this report, we describe the development of a quality improvement intervention to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and patient-centeredness of the donor candidate evaluation process. We developed a One-Day Living Kidney Donor Assessment Clinic, a condensed clinic where interested donor candidates complete all testing and consultations within 1 day. The One-Day Living Kidney Donor Assessment Clinic was developed after performing a comprehensive review of the literature, receiving feedback from patients who have successfully donated, and meetings with transplant program leadership from St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton. A multistakeholder team was formed that included health care staff from nephrology, transplant surgery, radiology, cardiology, social work, nuclear medicine, and patients with the prior lived experience of kidney donation. In the planning stages, the team met regularly to determine the objectives of the clinic, criteria for participation, clinic schedule, patient flow, and clinic metrics. Donor candidates entered the One-Day Clinic if they completed initial laboratory testing and agreed to an expedited process. If additional testing was required, it was completed on a different day. Donor candidates were reviewed by the nephrologist, transplant surgeon, and donor coordinator approximately 2 weeks after the clinic for final approval. The team continues to meet regularly to review donor feedback, discuss challenges, and brainstorm solutions. The One-Day Clinic was implemented in March 2019, and has now been running for 4 years, making iterative improvements through continuous patient and provider feedback. To date, we have evaluated more than 150 donor candidates in this clinic. Feedback from donors has been uniformly positive (98% of donors stated they were very satisfied with the clinic), with most noting that the clinic was efficient and minimally impacted work and family obligations. Hospital leadership, including the health care professionals from each participating department, continue to show support and collaborate to create a seamless experience for donor candidates attending the One-Day Clinic. Clinic spots are limited, meaning some interested donor candidates may not be able to enter a One-Day Clinic the same month they come forward. This patient-centered quality improvement intervention is designed to improve the efficiency and experience of the living kidney donor evaluation, result in better outcomes for kidney transplant recipients, and potentially increase living donation. Our next step is to conduct a formal evaluation of the clinic, measuring qualitative feedback from health care professionals working in the clinic and donor candidates attending the clinic, and measuring key process and outcome measures in donor candidates who completed the one-day assessment compared with those who underwent the usual care assessment. This program evaluation will provide reliable, regionally relevant evidence that will inform transplant centers across the country as they consider incorporating a similar one-day assessment model. Devenir donneur de rein vivant est difficile, le principal obstacle &#xe9;tant le processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation inefficace auquel les candidats doivent se soumettre. Ce processus comporte plus de 30 examens (p. ex. tests de laboratoire et tests diagnostiques), questionnaires et consultations avec des sp&#xe9;cialistes. Les candidats donneurs font plusieurs visites dans les h&#xf4;pitaux et cliniques, et passent souvent plusieurs mois &#xe0; attendre des rendez-vous et des r&#xe9;sultats de tests. En Ontario (Canada), le d&#xe9;lai m&#xe9;dian pour l&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation d&#x2019;un candidat au don est de pr&#xe8;s d&#x2019;un an. Les temps d&#x2019;attente plus longs sont associ&#xe9;s &#xe0; de moins bons r&#xe9;sultats pour les receveurs d&#x2019;une greffe r&#xe9;nale, ainsi qu&#x2019;&#xe0; des co&#xfb;ts de soins de sant&#xe9; plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9;s. Un processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation plus court et plus efficace des donneurs potentiels permettrait &#xe0; un plus grand nombre de patients atteints d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale de recevoir une greffe, y compris une greffe pr&#xe9;ventive (c.-&#xe0;-d. permettant d&#x2019;&#xe9;viter la dialyse).

La clinique d&#x2019;un jour pour l&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation des donneurs de reins vivants a &#xe9;t&#xe9; d&#xe9;velopp&#xe9;e &#xe0; la suite d&#x2019;un examen approfondi de la litt&#xe9;rature, de la consultation des commentaires de patients ayant donn&#xe9; avec succ&#xe8;s et de rencontres avec les dirigeants du programme de transplantation du St Joseph&#x2019;s Healthcare d&#x2019;Hamilton. Une &#xe9;quipe multipartite a &#xe9;t&#xe9; form&#xe9;e; celle-ci r&#xe9;unit du personnel soignant en n&#xe9;phrologie, chirurgie de transplantation, radiologie, cardiologie, travail social et m&#xe9;decine nucl&#xe9;aire, ainsi que des patients ayant une exp&#xe9;rience v&#xe9;cue du don de rein. L&#x2019;&#xe9;quipe s&#x2019;est r&#xe9;unie r&#xe9;guli&#xe8;rement pendant les &#xe9;tapes de planification pour d&#xe9;terminer les objectifs, les param&#xe8;tres et le calendrier de la clinique, ainsi que les crit&#xe8;res de participation et le flux de patients. Les donneurs potentiels qui avaient compl&#xe9;t&#xe9; les tests de laboratoire initiaux et qui acceptaient de se soumettre &#xe0; un processus acc&#xe9;l&#xe9;r&#xe9; ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; &#xe9;valu&#xe9;s &#xe0; la clinique d&#x2019;un jour. Si des tests suppl&#xe9;mentaires &#xe9;taient n&#xe9;cessaires, ceux-ci &#xe9;taient effectu&#xe9;s un autre jour. Les candidats ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; rencontr&#xe9;s par le n&#xe9;phrologue, le chirurgien de transplantation et le coordonnateur des dons environ deux semaines apr&#xe8;s leur visite &#xe0; la clinique pour l&#x2019;approbation finale. L&#x2019;&#xe9;quipe multipartite continue de se r&#xe9;unir r&#xe9;guli&#xe8;rement pour examiner les commentaires des donneurs, discuter des d&#xe9;fis et trouver des solutions. La clinique d&#x2019;un jour, mise sur pied en mars 2019, est en activit&#xe9; depuis quatre ans et permet des am&#xe9;liorations it&#xe9;ratives gr&#xe2;ce &#xe0; la r&#xe9;troaction continue des patients et des soignants. &#xc0; ce jour, plus de 150 candidats au don ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; &#xe9;valu&#xe9;s &#xe0; la clinique. Les commentaires des donneurs sont quasi unanimement positifs (98 % des candidats ont d&#xe9;clar&#xe9; &#xea;tre tr&#xe8;s satisfaits de la clinique), la plupart soulignant l&#x2019;efficacit&#xe9; de la clinique et les cons&#xe9;quences minimes du processus sur les obligations professionnelles et familiales. La direction de l&#x2019;h&#xf4;pital, tout comme les professionnels de la sant&#xe9; des services participants, continue d&#x2019;appuyer la clinique d&#x2019;un jour et de collaborer &#xe0; la cr&#xe9;ation d&#x2019;une exp&#xe9;rience fluide pour les donneurs potentiels qui la fr&#xe9;quentent. Les places &#xe0; la clinique sont limit&#xe9;es; ainsi, certains candidats au don d&#x2019;un rein vivant pourraient ne pas pouvoir &#xea;tre admis dans le mois o&#xf9; ils se pr&#xe9;sentent &#xe0; la clinique. Cette intervention d&#x2019;am&#xe9;lioration de la qualit&#xe9; ax&#xe9;e sur les patients est con&#xe7;ue pour augmenter l&#x2019;efficacit&#xe9; du processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation et bonifier l&#x2019;exp&#xe9;rience des donneurs de rein vivants. Elle vise &#xe9;galement &#xe0; am&#xe9;liorer les r&#xe9;sultats des receveurs d&#x2019;une greffe r&#xe9;nale et, potentiellement, augmenter le don vivant. La prochaine &#xe9;tape sera une &#xe9;valuation formelle de la clinique, c&#x2019;est-&#xe0;-dire la mesure de la r&#xe9;troaction qualitative des professionnels de la sant&#xe9; qui y travaillent et des candidats au don qui la fr&#xe9;quentent, et l&#x2019;analyse des processus cl&#xe9;s et des r&#xe9;sultats des candidats &#xe9;valu&#xe9;s &#xe0; la clinique d&#x2019;un jour par rapport &#xe0; ceux qui suivent le processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation habituel. Cette &#xe9;valuation du programme fournira des donn&#xe9;es probantes fiables et propres &#xe0; la r&#xe9;gion qui pourront informer les centres de transplantation de tout le pays qui envisagent d&#x2019;int&#xe9;grer un processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation similaire.",

      "abstract": "For decades, researchers have used linkable administrative health data for evaluating the health care system, subject to local privacy legislation. In Ontario, Canada, the relevant privacy legislation permits some organizations (prescribed entities) to conduct this kind of research but is silent on their ability to identify and contact individuals in those datasets. Following consultation with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, we developed a pilot study to identify and contact by mail a sample of people at high risk for kidney failure within the next 2 years, based on laboratory and administrative data from provincial datasets held by ICES, to ensure they receive needed kidney care. Before proceeding, we conducted six focus groups to understand the acceptability to the public and people living with chronic kidney disease of direct mail outreach to people at high risk of developing kidney failure. While virtually all participants indicated they would likely participate in the study, most felt strongly that the message should come directly from their primary care provider or whoever ordered the laboratory tests, rather than from an unknown organization. If this is not possible, they felt the health care provider should be made aware of the concern related to their kidney health. Most agreed that, if health authorities could identify people at high risk of a treatable life-threatening illness if caught early enough, there is a social responsibility to notify people. While privacy laws allow for free flow of health information among health care providers who provide direct clinical care, the proposed case-finding and outreach falls outside that model. Enabling this kind of information flow will require greater clarity in existing laws or revisions to these laws. This also requires adequate notification and culture change for health care providers and the public around information uses and flows.",

      "abstract": "Patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis have multiple comorbidities and are at high risk of presenting to the hospital. However, the incidence and cost of acute health care utilization in the in-center hemodialysis population and how this compares with other populations is poorly understood. To determine the rate, pattern, and cost of emergency department visits and hospitalizations in patients receiving in-center hemodialysis compared with a matched general population. Population-based matched cohort study. We used linked administrative health care databases from Ontario, Canada. We included 25&#x2009;379 patients (incident and prevalent) receiving in-center hemodialysis between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. Patients were matched on birth date (&#xb1;2 years), sex, and cohort entry date using a 1:4 ratio to 101&#x2009;516 individuals from the general population. Our primary outcomes were emergency department visits (allowing for multiple visits per individual) and hospital admissions from the emergency department. We also assessed all-cause hospitalizations, all-cause readmissions within 30 days of discharge from the original hospitalization, length of stay for hospital admissions (including multiple visits per individual), and the financial cost of these admissions. We presented the rate, percentage, median (25th, 75th percentiles), and incidence rate per 1000 person-years for emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Individual-level health care costs for emergency department visits and all-cause hospitalization were estimated using resource intensity weights multiplied by the cost per weighted case. Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis had substantially more comorbidities (eg, diabetes) than the matched general population. Eighty percent (n = 20&#x2009;309) of patients receiving in-center hemodialysis had at least 1 emergency department visit compared with 56% (n = 56&#x2009;452) of individuals in the matched general population, over a median follow-up of 1.8 years (25th, 75th percentiles: 0.7, 3.6) and 5.2 (2.5, 8.4) years, respectively. The incidence rate of emergency department visits, allowing for multiple visits per individual, was 2274 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2263, 2286) for patients receiving in-center hemodialysis, which was almost 5 times as high as the matched general population (471 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI: 469, 473). The rate of hospital admissions from the emergency department and the rate of all-cause hospital admissions in the in-center hemodialysis population was more than 7 times as high as the matched general population (hospital admissions from the emergency department: 786 vs 101 per 1000 person-years; all-cause hospital admissions: 1056 vs 139 per 1000 person-years). The median number of all-cause hospitalization days per patient year was 4.0 (0, 16.5) in the in-center hemodialysis population compared with 0 (0, 0.5) in the matched general population. The cost per patient-year for emergency department visits in the in-center hemodialysis population was approximately 5.5 times as high as the matched general population while the cost of hospitalizations in the in-center hemodialysis population was approximately 11 times as high as the matched general population (emergency department visits: CAN$ 1153 vs CAN$ 209; hospitalizations: CAN$ 21&#x2009;151 vs CAN$ 1873 [all costs in 2023 CAN$]). External generalizability and we could not determine whether emergency department visits and hospitalizations were preventable. Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis have high acute health care utilization. These results improve our understanding of the burden of disease and the associated costs in the in-center hemodialysis population, highlight the need to improve acute outcomes, and can aid health care capacity planning. Additional research is needed to address the risk of hospitalization after controlling for patient comorbidities. This is not applicable as this is a population-based matched cohort study and not a clinical trial.

Au cours d&#x2019;un suivi m&#xe9;dian respectif de 1,8 an (25<sup>e</sup> et 75<sup>e</sup> percentile: 0,7 et 3,6 ans) et de 5,2 ans (2,5 et 8,4 ans), 80 % (n=20&#x2009;309) des patients h&#xe9;modialys&#xe9;s en center ont visit&#xe9; l&#x2019;urgence au moins une fois, contre 56 % (n= 56&#x2009;452) des patients de la population g&#xe9;n&#xe9;rale appari&#xe9;e. Le taux d&#x2019;incidence des visites aux urgences, en permettant plusieurs visites par personne, &#xe9;tait de 2274 pour 1000 ann&#xe9;es-personnes (intervalle de confiance &#xe0; 95% [IC 95%]: 2 263 &#xe0; 2 286) chez les patients h&#xe9;modialys&#xe9;s en center, soit presque cinq fois plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9; que la population g&#xe9;n&#xe9;rale appari&#xe9;e (471 pour 1000 ann&#xe9;es-personnes; IC95 %: 469 &#xe0; 473).

      "abstract": "In some jurisdictions, individuals become eligible or recommended for referral for different types of kidney care using criteria based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Historically, GFR was estimated with an equation developed in 2009, which included a Black race term. An updated, race-free equation was developed in 2021. It is unclear how adoption of the 2021 equation will influence the number of individuals meeting referral criteria to receive different types of kidney care. To develop population-based estimates on how the number of individuals meeting the eGFR-based referral criteria to receive three different types of kidney care (nephrologist consultation, care in a multi-care specialty clinic, kidney transplant evaluation) changes when the 2021 versus 2009 equation is used to calculate eGFR. Population-based, cross-sectional study. Ontario, Canada's most populous province with 14.2 million residents as of 2021. Less than 5% of Ontario's residents self-identify as being of Black race. Adults with at least one outpatient serum creatinine measurement in the 2 years prior to December 31, 2021. Referral criteria to 3 different types of kidney care: nephrologist consultation, multi-care specialty clinic, and evaluation for a kidney transplant. The eGFR thresholds used to define referral eligibility or recommendation for these kidney health services were based on guidelines from Ontario's provincial renal agency. The number of individuals meeting referral criteria for the 3 different healthcare services was compared between the 2009 and 2021 equations, restricted to individuals not yet receiving that level of care. As individual-level race data were not available, estimates were repeated, randomly assigning a Black race status to 1%, 5%, and 10% of the population. We had an outpatient serum creatinine measurement available for 1&#x2009;048&#x2009;110 adults. Using the 2009 equation, 37&#x2009;345 individuals met the criteria to be referred to a nephrologist, 10&#x2009;019 met the criteria to receive care in a multi-care specialty clinic, and 10&#x2009;178 met the criteria to be referred for kidney transplant evaluation. Corresponding numbers with the 2021 equation (and the percent relative to the 2009 equation) were 26&#x2009;645 (71.3%), 9009 (89.9%), and 8615 (84.6%) individuals, respectively. These numbers were largely unchanged when Black race was assumed in up to 10% of the population. Referral criteria based solely on urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were not assessed. Self-reported race data were unavailable. For healthcare planning, in regions where a minority of the population is Black, a substantial number of individuals may no longer meet referral criteria for different types of kidney healthcare following adoption of the new 2021 eGFR equation. Dans certaines r&#xe9;gions, les individus sont dirig&#xe9;s vers diff&#xe9;rents types de soins r&#xe9;naux, ou y deviennent admissibles, selon des crit&#xe8;res fond&#xe9;s sur le d&#xe9;bit de filtration glom&#xe9;rulaire estim&#xe9; (DFGe). Historiquement, le DFG &#xe9;tait estim&#xe9; avec une &#xe9;quation d&#xe9;velopp&#xe9;e en 2009 comportant un terme qui tenait compte du fait d&#x2019;&#xea;tre une personne de race noire. Une nouvelle &#xe9;quation sans mention de la race a &#xe9;t&#xe9; d&#xe9;velopp&#xe9;e en 2021. Il est difficile de savoir comment l&#x2019;adoption de l&#x2019;&#xe9;quation de 2021 influencera le nombre de personnes qui r&#xe9;pondront aux crit&#xe8;res pour recevoir divers types de soins r&#xe9;naux. &#xc9;tablir des estimations populationnelles de la variation du nombre de personnes qui r&#xe9;pondent aux crit&#xe8;res d&#x2019;orientation fond&#xe9;s sur le DFGe pour recevoir trois diff&#xe9;rents types de soins r&#xe9;naux (consultation avec un n&#xe9;phrologue, soins dans une clinique multidisciplinaire sp&#xe9;cialis&#xe9;e, &#xe9;valuation pour une transplantation r&#xe9;nale) selon que le DFGe est calcul&#xe9; avec l&#x2019;&#xe9;quation de 2021 ou de 2009. &#xc9;tude populationnelle transversale r&#xe9;trospective.

      "abstract": "Research teams are increasingly interested in using cluster randomized trial (CRT) designs to generate practice-guiding evidence for in-center maintenance hemodialysis. However, CRTs raise complex ethical issues. The Ottawa Statement on the Ethical Design and Conduct of Cluster Randomized Trials, published in 2012, provides 15 recommendations to address ethical issues arising within 7 domains: justifying the CRT design, research ethics committee review, identifying research participants, obtaining informed consent, gatekeepers, assessing benefits and harms, and protecting vulnerable participants. But applying the Ottawa Statement recommendations to CRTs in the hemodialysis setting is complicated by the unique features of the setting and population. Here, with the help of content experts and patient partners, we co-developed this implementation guidance document to provide research teams, research ethics committees, and other stakeholders with detailed guidance on how to apply the Ottawa Statement recommendations to CRTs in the hemodialysis setting, the result of a 4-year research project. Thus, our work demonstrates how the voices of patients, caregivers, and all stakeholders may be included in the development of research ethics guidance.",

      "abstract": "Recent guidelines call for better evidence on health outcomes after living kidney donation. To determine the risk of hypertension in normotensive adults who donated a kidney compared with nondonors of similar baseline health. Their rates of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and risk of albuminuria were also compared. Prospective cohort study of 924 standard-criteria living kidney donors enrolled before surgery and a concurrent sample of 396 nondonors. Recruitment occurred from 2004 to 2014 from 17 transplant centers (12 in Canada and 5 in Australia); follow-up occurred until November 2021. Donors and nondonors had the same annual schedule of follow-up assessments. Inverse probability of treatment weighting on a propensity score was used to balance donors and nondonors on baseline characteristics. Living kidney donation. Hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &#x2265;140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &#x2265;90 mm Hg, or antihypertensive medication), annualized change in eGFR (starting 12 months after donation/simulated donation date in nondonors), and albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio &#x2265;3 mg/mmol [&#x2265;30 mg/g]). Among the 924 donors, 66% were female; they had a mean age of 47 years and a mean eGFR of 100 mL/min/1.73 m2. Donors were more likely than nondonors to have a family history of kidney failure (464/922 [50%] vs 89/394 [23%], respectively). After statistical weighting, the sample of nondonors increased to 928 and baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. During a median follow-up of 7.3 years (IQR, 6.0-9.0), in weighted analysis, hypertension occurred in 161 of 924 donors (17%) and 158 of 928 nondonors (17%) (weighted hazard ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.75-1.66]). The longitudinal change in mean blood pressure was similar in donors and nondonors. After the initial drop in donors' eGFR after nephrectomy (mean, 32 mL/min/1.73 m2), donors had a 1.4-mL/min/1.73 m2 (95% CI, 1.2-1.5) per year lesser decline in eGFR than nondonors. However, more donors than nondonors had an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at least once in follow-up (438/924 [47%] vs 49/928 [5%]). Albuminuria occurred in 132 of 905 donors (15%) and 95 of 904 nondonors (11%) (weighted hazard ratio, 1.46 [95% CI, 0.97-2.21]); the weighted between-group difference in the albumin to creatinine ratio was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.88-1.19). In this cohort study of living kidney donors and nondonors with the same follow-up schedule, the risks of hypertension and albuminuria were not significantly different. After the initial drop in eGFR from nephrectomy, donors had a slower mean rate of eGFR decline than nondonors but were more likely to have an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at least once in follow-up.

      "abstract": "It is unclear whether the use of higher dialysate bicarbonate concentrations is associated with clinically relevant changes in the pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration. The objective is to examine the association between the dialysate bicarbonate prescription and the pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration. This is a retrospective cohort study. The study was performed using linked administrative health care databases in Ontario, Canada. Prevalent adults receiving maintenance in-center hemodialysis as of April 1, 2020 (n = 5414) were included. Patients were grouped into the following dialysate bicarbonate categories at the dialysis center-level: individualized (adjustment based on pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration) or standardized (&gt;90% of patients received the same dialysate bicarbonate concentration). The standardized category was stratified by concentration: 35, 36 to 37, and &#x2265;38 mmol/L. The primary outcome was the mean outpatient pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration at the patient level. We examined the association between dialysate bicarbonate category and pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate using an adjusted linear mixed model. All dialysate bicarbonate categories had a mean pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration within the normal range. In the individualized category, 91% achieved a pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate &#x2265;22 mmol/L, compared to 87% in the standardized category. Patients in the standardized category tended to have a serum bicarbonate that was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.93, 0.43) mmol/L lower than patients in the individualized category. Relative to patients in the 35 mmol/L category, patients in the 36 to 37 and &#x2265;38 mmol/L categories tended to have a serum bicarbonate that was 0.70 (95% CI = -0.30, 1.70) mmol/L and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.14, 1.60) mmol/L higher, respectively. There was no effect modification by age, sex, or history of chronic lung disease. We could not directly confirm that all laboratory measurements were pre-dialysis. Data on prescribed dialysate bicarbonate concentrations for individual dialysis sessions were not available, which may have led to some misclassification, and adherence to a practice of individualization could not be measured. Residual confounding is possible. We found no significant difference in the pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration irrespective of whether an individualized or standardized dialysate bicarbonate was used. Dialysate bicarbonate concentrations &#x2265;38 mmol/L (vs 35 mmol/L) may increase the pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate concentration by 0.9 mmol/L.

All registered physicians in Ontario, Canada using data from linked provincial administrative healthcare databases. 41&#x2009;267 physicians (including postgraduate trainees) who were Ontario residents and registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario were included. Physicians who were out of province, had not accessed Ontario Health Insurance Plan-insured services for their own care for &#x2265;5 years and those with missing identifiers were excluded. Primary outcomes were the proportions of physicians who were recorded to have received at least one, at least two and three doses of a Health Canada-approved COVID-19 vaccine by study end date. Secondary outcomes were how uptake varied by physician characteristics (including age, sex, specialty and residential location) and time elapsed between doses. Of 41 267 physicians, (56% male, mean age 47 years), 39 359 (95.4%) received at least one dose, 39 148 (94.9%) received at least two doses and 35 834 (86.8%) received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Of those who received three doses, the proportions were 90.4% among those aged &#x2265;60 years&#x2009;and 81.2-89.5% among other age groups; 88.7% among family physicians and 89% among specialists. 1908 physicians (4.6%) had no record of vaccination, and this included 3.4% of family physicians and 4.1% of specialists; however, 28% of this group had missing specialty information. In Ontario, within 14 months of COVID-19 vaccine availability, 86.8% of physicians had three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, compared with 45.6% of the general population. Findings may signify physicians' confidence in the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.",

Small changes in digoxin concentration could predispose individuals to the risk of toxicity. To characterize the risk of digoxin toxicity in older adults taking digoxin following co-prescription of TMP-SMX compared with co-prescription of amoxicillin. Retrospective population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada (2002-2020) using linked health care data. Participants comprised 47,961 older adults taking digoxin (58% women; median age 80&#x2009;years [interquartile range 74-86]) who were newly treated with TMP-SMX (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;10,273) compared with those newly treated with amoxicillin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;37,688). Co-prescription of TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin in older adults concurrently taking digoxin. The primary outcome was a hospital encounter (i.e., hospital admission or emergency department visit) with digoxin toxicity within 30&#x2009;days of the antibiotic prescription. Inverse probability of treatment weighting on the propensity score was used to balance comparison groups on indicators of baseline health. Weighted risk ratios (RR) were obtained using modified Poisson regression and weighted risk differences (RD) using binomial regression. The number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated as 1/RD. A hospital encounter with digoxin toxicity occurred in 49/10,273 (0.48%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 32/37,688 (0.08%) in those treated with amoxicillin (weighted RR, 5.71 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.19 to 10.24]; weighted RD, 0.39% [95% CI, 0.25% to 0.53%]; NNH 256 [95% CI, 233 to 400]). In older adults taking digoxin, the 30-day risk of a hospital encounter with digoxin toxicity was nearly 6 times higher in those co-prescribed TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin, although the absolute risk difference was low (0.4%). Physicians should prescribe an alternative antibiotic when clinically appropriate. If TMP-SMX must be co-prescribed with digoxin (if the benefit is believed to outweigh the risk), digoxin should be dose-reduced on an individual basis.",

We conducted a population-based cohort study using linked administrative healthcare databases from Ontario, Canada to answer this question. We included 15&#x2009;306 solid organ transplant recipients and 12&#x2009;160&#x2009;904 individuals from the general population. Our primary outcome was the rate (per 100 person-years) of severe COVID-19 (ie, hospitalization or death with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test) occurring between January 25, 2020, and November 30, 2022. Compared with the general population, solid organ transplant recipients had almost a 6 times higher rate of severe COVID-19 (20.39 versus 3.44 per 100 person-years), with almost 5.5 times as high a rate of death alone (4.19 versus 0.77 per 100 person-years). Transplant recipients with severe COVID-19 were substantially younger (60.1 versus 66.5 y) and had more comorbidities. The rate of severe COVID-19 declined over time in the solid organ transplant population, with an incidence rate of 41.25 per 100 person-years in the first wave (January 25, 2020, to August 31, 2020) and 18.41 in the seventh wave (June 19, 2022, to November 30, 2022, Omicron era). Solid organ transplant recipients remain at high risk of severe outcomes when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Resources and strategies to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 exposure are needed in this vulnerable patient population.",

      "abstract": "Among 4173 children with AKI, 18% had major adverse kidney events (death, kidney failure, or CKD) during a median 10-year follow-up. AKI survivors were at 2&#x2013;4 times higher risk of major adverse kidney events, hypertension, and subsequent AKI versus matched hospitalized comparators. This justifies improved surveillance after pediatric AKI to detect CKD and hypertension early and improve long-term kidney health. AKI is common in hospitalized children. Pediatric AKI receiving acute KRT is associated with long-term CKD, hypertension, and death. We aim to determine the outcomes after AKI in children who did not receive acute KRT because these remain uncertain. Retrospective cohort study of all hospitalized children (0&#x2013;18 years) surviving AKI without acute KRT between 1996 and 2020 in Ontario, Canada, identified by validated diagnostic codes in provincial administrative health databases. Children with prior KRT, CKD, or AKI were excluded. Cases were matched with up to four hospitalized comparators without AKI by age, neonatal status, sex, intensive care unit admission, cardiac surgery, malignancy, hypertension, hospitalization era, and a propensity score for AKI. Patients were followed until death, provincial emigration, or censoring in March 2021. The primary outcome was long-term major adverse kidney events (a composite of all-cause mortality, long-term KRT, or incident CKD). We matched 4173 pediatric AKI survivors with 16,337 hospitalized comparators. Baseline covariates were well-balanced following propensity score matching. During a median 9.7-year follow-up, 18% of AKI survivors developed long-term major adverse kidney event versus 5% of hospitalized comparators (hazard ratio [HR], 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 4.4). AKI survivors had higher rates of long-term KRT (2% versus &lt;1%; HR, 11.7; 95% CI, 7.5 to 18.4), incident CKD (16% versus 2%; HR, 7.9; 95% CI, 6.9 to 9.1), incident hypertension (17% versus 8%; HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 2.1 to 2.6), and AKI during subsequent hospitalization (6% versus 2%; HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.1 to 4.5), but no difference in all-cause mortality (3% versus 3%; HR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.1). Children surviving AKI without acute KRT were at higher long-term risk of CKD, long-term KRT, hypertension, and subsequent AKI versus hospitalized comparators.",

      "abstract": "A substantial proportion of living kidney donors are women of childbearing age. Some prior studies report a higher risk of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia in living kidney donors compared with nondonors. Further research is needed to better quantify the risk of adverse maternal, fetal/infant, and neonatal outcomes attributable to living kidney donation. To determine the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia, and other maternal and fetal/infant outcomes in living kidney donors compared with a matched group of nondonors of similar baseline health. Protocol for a population-based, matched cohort study using Canadian administrative health care databases. The protocol will be run separately in 3 provinces, Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia, and results will be combined statistically using meta-analysis. The cohort will include women aged 18 to 48 years who donated a kidney between July 1992 and March 2022 and had at least one postdonation singleton pregnancy of &#x2265;20 weeks gestation between January 1993 and February 2023. We expect to include at least 150 living kidney donors with over 200 postdonation pregnancies from Ontario and a similar number of donors and pregnancies across Alberta and British Columbia combined. Nondonors will include women from the general population with at least one pregnancy of &#x2265;20 weeks gestation between January 1993 and February 2023. Nondonors will be randomly assigned cohort entry dates based on the distribution of nephrectomy dates in donors. The sample of nondonors will be restricted to those aged 18 to 48 years on their cohort entry dates with delivery dates at least 6 months after their assigned entry dates. A concern with donor and nondonor comparisons is that donors are healthier than the general population. To reduce this concern, we will also apply 30+ exclusion criteria to further restrict the nondonor group so that they have similar health measures at cohort entry as the donors. Donor and nondonor pregnancies will then be matched (1:4) on 5 potential confounders: delivery date, maternal age at delivery date, time between cohort entry and delivery date, neighborhood income quintile, and parity at delivery date. The primary outcome will be a composite of maternal gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia. Secondary maternal outcomes will include components of the primary outcome, early pre-eclampsia, severe maternal morbidity, cesarean section, postpartum hemorrhage, and gestational diabetes. Fetal/infant/neonatal outcomes will include premature birth/low birth weight, small for gestational age, neonatal intensive care unit admission, stillbirth, and neonatal death. The primary unit of analysis will be the pregnancy. We will compute the risk ratio of the primary composite outcome in donors versus nondonors using a log-binomial mixed regression model with random effects to account for the correlation within women with multiple pregnancies and within matched sets of donors and nondonors. We will perform the statistical analyses within each province and then combine aggregated results using meta-analytic techniques to produce overall estimates of the study outcomes. Due to regulations that prevent individual-level records from being sent to other provinces, we cannot pool individual-level data from all 3 provinces. Compared to prior studies, this study will better estimate the donation-attributable risk of adverse maternal, fetal/infant, and neonatal outcomes. Transplant centers can use the results to counsel female living donor candidates of childbearing age and to inform recommended practices for the follow-up and care of living kidney donors who become pregnant.

Nous pr&#xe9;voyons inclure au moins 150&#x2009;donneuses de rein vivantes avec plus de 200&#x2009;grossesses post-don en Ontario et des nombres similaires en combinant les donneuses et les grossesses pour l&#x2019;Alberta et la Colombie-Britannique. Les non-donneuses seront des femmes de la population g&#xe9;n&#xe9;rale ayant eu au moins une grossesse de plus de 20&#x2009;semaines entre janvier 1993 et f&#xe9;vrier 2023. Les non-donneuses se verront attribuer au hasard une date d&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte en fonction des dates de n&#xe9;phrectomie chez les donneuses.

Using linked healthcare data in Ontario, we conducted a population-based cohort study on adults aged &#x2265;66&#x2009;years not receiving dialysis and newly prescribed oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir in the outpatient setting (2008-2022) at higher versus lower doses. The primary composite outcome, a hospital visit with encephalopathy or acute kidney injury (AKI) within 14&#x2009;days of initiating antiviral treatment, was examined in a primary cohort. AKI was assessed in a secondary cohort of older adults with CKD with available linked hospital-based laboratory (lab) data. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting on the propensity score to balance comparison groups on baseline health. Weighted risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) were obtained using modified Poisson and binomial regression. In the primary cohort, higher- versus lower-dose antiviral was not associated with an increased 14-day risk of hospital visit with encephalopathy or AKI. However, Higher- versus lower-dose antiviral was associated with a higher risk of a hospital visit with AKI when assessed using lab values (weighted number of events, 70 of 8407 [0.83%] versus 18 of 8230 [0.22%], respectively; weighted RR, 3.83 [95% CI, 1.87-7.87]; weighted RD, 0.62% [95% CI, 0.37%-0.86%]).

Altogether, 7307 patients were included from 110 hospitals in 22 countries. Patients were 45 years and older, had or were at risk of atherosclerotic disease, took at least one antihypertensive medication, and were scheduled for noncardiac surgery. Hypotension-avoidance strategy: (i) target intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) 80 mm&#xa0;Hg or over, (ii) on day of surgery and for two days after, hold renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and use other antihypertensives in stepwise fashion if systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 mm&#xa0;Hg or more. Hypertension-avoidance strategy: (i) target intraoperative MAP 60 mm&#xa0;Hg or more, (ii) continue all antihypertensives before and after surgery. Primary outcome: postoperative AKI, an increase in serum creatinine concentration of either 26.5 &#x3bc;mol/L or more (0.3 mg/dL or more) within 48 hours of randomization or 50% or more within seven days of randomization. The hypotension-avoidance group (3654 patients) used fewer antihypertensive medications than the hypertension-avoidance group (3653 patients); specifically, 6% vs. 38% used an ACEI or ARB on the day of surgery, and 6% vs. 47% and 7% vs. 50% one and two days after surgery, respectively. Patients also spent about half as much intraoperative time with a MAP under 80 mm&#xa0;Hg (27 vs. 60 minutes, respectively), but had little difference in average BP before or after surgery. There was no significant difference in AKI risk (15.1% vs. 14.4%). Results were consistent with other definitions of AKI and in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease. Thus, a hypotension-avoidance strategy targeting a MAP greater than 80 mm&#xa0;Hg in the operating room and discontinued blood pressure medication during the perioperative period did not confer a lower risk of AKI compared to a hypertension avoidance strategy.

      "abstract": "Using data from Ontario, Canada, this report shows how provincial government-assigned health card numbers can be used for individual-level randomization in large pragmatic trials. We describe how health card numbers are assigned and analyze the distribution of health card digits in a trial setting. We then provide an example of how they can be used for randomization and discuss the methodological and practical considerations of the approach. In Ontario, Canada, health card numbers are randomly generated and assigned without regard to the applicant's characteristics. The number is a 10-digit string connected with hyphens followed by a version code (ie, 1234-567-890-XX). The number is unique to each individual and assigned for life. Before assignment, some numbers within the 10 digits are altered using proprietary business rules. We demonstrate how to use certain digits for individual-level randomization and provide an example of how we will use the tenth digit for randomization in a large new trial of different dialysate bicarbonate concentrations. While this approach has many practical and methodological advantages, it does not allow for stratification. Before using this approach, teams should consider if it will affect the integrity of the randomization and the trial, which will be influenced by the setting and the type of intervention tested. Using provincial government-assigned health card numbers for pragmatic randomized trials appears viable, but the merits must be carefully considered on a trial-by-trial basis. The approach can streamline and reduce the cost of conducting such trials. &#xc0; l&#x2019;aide des donn&#xe9;es de l&#x2019;Ontario (Canada), ce rapport montre la fa&#xe7;on dont les num&#xe9;ros de carte d&#x2019;assurance-maladie attribu&#xe9;s par le gouvernement provincial peuvent &#xea;tre utilis&#xe9;s pour la randomisation individuelle dans les essais pragmatiques de grande envergure.

En Ontario, au Canada, les num&#xe9;ros de carte d&#x2019;assurance-maladie sont g&#xe9;n&#xe9;r&#xe9;s al&#xe9;atoirement et attribu&#xe9;s sans &#xe9;gards aux caract&#xe9;ristiques du demandeur. Le num&#xe9;ro est une s&#xe9;rie de 10 chiffres reli&#xe9;s par des tirets et suivis d&#x2019;un code de version (p. ex., 1234-567-890-XX). Ce num&#xe9;ro assign&#xe9; &#xe0; vie est unique &#xe0; chaque individu. Avant l&#x2019;attribution, certains chiffres de la s&#xe9;rie sont modifi&#xe9;s suivant des r&#xe8;gles de gestion propri&#xe9;taires. Nous expliquons comment certains chiffres de la s&#xe9;rie peuvent &#xea;tre employ&#xe9;s pour la randomisation individuelle, en montrant la fa&#xe7;on dont nous utiliserons le dixi&#xe8;me chiffre de la s&#xe9;rie pour randomiser les sujets dans un nouvel essai de grande envergure portant sur diff&#xe9;rentes concentrations de bicarbonate dans le dialysat. Cette approche pr&#xe9;sente plusieurs avantages sur les plans de la pratique et de la m&#xe9;thodologie, mais elle ne permet pas la stratification. Avant de choisir cette approche, les &#xe9;quipes doivent d&#xe9;terminer si elle affectera l&#x2019;int&#xe9;grit&#xe9; de la randomisation et de l&#x2019;essai, laquelle sera influenc&#xe9;e par le contexte et le type d&#x2019;intervention test&#xe9;e. L&#x2019;utilisation des num&#xe9;ros d&#x2019;assurance-maladie attribu&#xe9;s par le gouvernement provincial semble une approche viable dans les essais randomis&#xe9;s pragmatiques. Son bien-fond&#xe9; doit cependant &#xea;tre soigneusement examin&#xe9; au cas par cas. Cette approche peut rationaliser la conduite de tels essais et en r&#xe9;duire les co&#xfb;ts.",

      "abstract": "Optimised use of kidney function information might improve cardiac risk prediction in noncardiac surgery. In 35,815 patients from the VISION cohort study and 9219 patients from the POISE-2 trial who were &#x2265;45 yr old and underwent nonurgent inpatient noncardiac surgery, we examined (by age and sex) the association between continuous nonlinear preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the composite of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death owing to a cardiac cause within 30 days after surgery. We estimated contributions of predictive information, C-statistic, and net benefit from eGFR and other common patient and surgical characteristics to large multivariable models. The primary composite occurred in 4725 (13.2%) patients in VISION and 1903 (20.6%) in POISE-2; in both studies cardiac events had a strong, graded association with lower preoperative eGFR that was attenuated by older age (P<sub>interaction</sub>&lt;0.001 for VISION; P<sub>interaction</sub>=0.008 for POISE-2). For eGFR of 30 compared with 90 ml min<sup>-1</sup> 1.73 m<sup>-2</sup>, relative risk was 1.49 (95% confidence interval 1.26-1.78) at age 80 yr but 4.50 (2.84-7.13) at age 50 yr in female patients in VISION. This differed modestly (but not meaningfully) in men in VISION (P<sub>interaction</sub>=0.02) but not in POISE-2 (P<sub>interaction</sub>=0.79). eGFR contributed the most predictive information and mean net benefit of all predictors in both studies, most C-statistic in VISION, and third most C-statistic in POISE-2. Continuous preoperative eGFR is among the best cardiac risk predictors in noncardiac surgery of the large set examined. Along with its interaction with age, preoperative eGFR would improve risk calculators. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00512109 (VISION) and NCT01082874 (POISE-2).",

      "abstract": "Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining treatment for patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, patients on dialysis continue to face poor quality of life and short life expectancies. Despite this, the nephrology community conducts the fewest randomized controlled trials of any medical discipline, relying instead on expert opinion to guide many aspects of hemodialysis care. There is a need to conduct high-quality pragmatic randomized controlled trials in hemodialysis to drive evidence-based practice. To this end, the Innovative Clinical Trials in Hemodialysis Centers initiative, with the support of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and its Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research, funded the development of 6 pragmatic trial protocols. Gardener's Grove 2023 created a space to support the development of these trials and increase awareness and knowledge of past, ongoing, and future innovative, pragmatic, randomized controlled registry trials embedded in routine hemodialysis care. This report summarizes the proceedings of this conference. The conference included 6 panel presentations, each featuring an overview of a new pragmatic trial followed by expert panel feedback from patient partners, nephrologists, researchers, and health care providers. The conference also included 10 educational sessions led by clinicians and researchers with experience in the fields of kidney medicine and clinical trials. Gardener's Grove 2023 was a 4-day virtual conference held in March of 2023. Recordings of all the conference presentations were later published on the Gardener's Grove website and are summarized in the Supplemental Appendix of this report. The conference brought together 118 Canadian and international researchers, patients, and health care providers to collaborate on 6 pragmatic trials intended to test interventions to improve hemodialysis care. The proposed trials included (1) PREventing FracturEs in REnal Disease (PREFERRED), (2) DIALysis with EXpanded solute removal (DIALEX), (3) Sodium fOr diaLysis oUTcome rEduction (SOLUTE), (4) Finding the right blood pressure target for patients on dialysis, (5) DIuretic Use in patients with Residual renal function on hemodialysis (DIURESED), and (6) Lower vs higher dialysate bicarbonate concentration in patients receiving hemodialysis (Dial-Bicarb). All of these interventions were widely supported and received valuable feedback from panelists and conference attendees. The education sessions focused on various design and execution elements of pragmatic, randomized controlled registry trials embedded in routine care. The conference could have been improved by streamlining session topics and pacing, allowing additional time for discussions, strengthening online network opportunities, and improving survey response rates. A follow-up conference is planned to take place in a few years, and the coordinators will aim to implement these changes. Gardener's Grove 2023 successfully created a space for patients, researchers, and health care providers to support the development of 6 new pragmatic trials in hemodialysis care. Since Gardener's Grove 2023, several of these trials have secured CIHR funding, obtained ethics approval, and are actively preparing to launch their interventions. L&#x2019;h&#xe9;modialyse est un traitement vital pour les personnes souffrant d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale terminale. Les patients sous h&#xe9;modialyse voient cependant leur qualit&#xe9; et leur esp&#xe9;rance de vie r&#xe9;duites. Malgr&#xe9; cela, la communaut&#xe9; de la n&#xe9;phrologie est celle parmi toutes les disciplines m&#xe9;dicales qui m&#xe8;ne le moins d&#x2019;essais contr&#xf4;l&#xe9;s randomis&#xe9;s, s&#x2019;appuyant plut&#xf4;t sur l&#x2019;opinion d&#x2019;experts pour guider de nombreux aspects des soins d&#x2019;h&#xe9;modialyse. Des essais contr&#xf4;l&#xe9;s, randomis&#xe9;s, pragmatiques de haute qualit&#xe9; sont n&#xe9;cessaires en h&#xe9;modialyse pour encourager une pratique fond&#xe9;e sur des donn&#xe9;es probantes. C&#x2019;est pourquoi l&#x2019;Initiative sur les essais cliniques novateurs dans les centres d&#x2019;h&#xe9;modialyse, avec l&#x2019;appui des Instituts de recherche en sant&#xe9; du Canada et de la Strat&#xe9;gie de recherche ax&#xe9;e sur le patient, finance l&#x2019;&#xe9;laboration de six protocoles d&#x2019;essais pragmatiques en h&#xe9;modialyse. La conf&#xe9;rence Gardener&#x2019;s Grove de 2023 a cr&#xe9;&#xe9; un espace pour soutenir le d&#xe9;veloppement de ces essais et accro&#xee;tre la sensibilisation et la connaissance sur les essais innovants, pragmatiques, randomis&#xe9;s et contr&#xf4;l&#xe9;s&#x2014;pass&#xe9;s, en cours et futurs&#x2014;int&#xe9;gr&#xe9;s dans les soins courants d&#x2019;h&#xe9;modialyse. Le pr&#xe9;sent rapport r&#xe9;sume les travaux de cette conf&#xe9;rence. La conf&#xe9;rence pr&#xe9;voyait six pr&#xe9;sentations de panel, chacune donnant un aper&#xe7;u d&#x2019;un nouvel essai pragmatique suivi des commentaires d&#x2019;experts, de partenaires patients, de n&#xe9;phrologues, de chercheurs et de prestataires de soins. Dix s&#xe9;ances de formation anim&#xe9;es par des cliniciens et des chercheurs ayant une exp&#xe9;rience en m&#xe9;decine r&#xe9;nale et en essais cliniques figuraient &#xe9;galement au programme. Gardener&#x2019;s Grove&#x2009;2023 est une conf&#xe9;rence virtuelle de quatre jours qui s&#x2019;est tenue en mars&#x2009;2023. Les enregistrements de toutes les pr&#xe9;sentations ont ensuite &#xe9;t&#xe9; publi&#xe9;s sur le site Web de Gardener&#x2019;s Grove; ils sont r&#xe9;sum&#xe9;s dans l&#x2019;annexe suppl&#xe9;mentaire du pr&#xe9;sent rapport. La conf&#xe9;rence a r&#xe9;uni 118&#x2009;chercheurs, patients et prestataires de soins canadiens et internationaux pour collaborer &#xe0; six essais pragmatiques pour tester des interventions visant &#xe0; am&#xe9;liorer les soins d&#x2019;h&#xe9;modialyse. Les essais propos&#xe9;s sont les suivants&#x2009;: 1) l&#x2019;essai PREFERRED (<i>PREventing FracturEs in REnal Disease</i>); 2) l&#x2019;essai DIALEX (<i>DIALysis with EXpanded solute removal</i>); 3) l&#x2019;essai SODIUM (<i>Sodium fOr diaLysis oUTcome rEduction</i>); 4) un essai portant sur les cibles de pression art&#xe9;rielle pour les patients sous dialyse (<i>Finding the right blood pressure target for patients on dialysis);</i> 5) l&#x2019;essai DIURESED (<i>DIuretic Use in patients with Residual renal function on hemodialysis</i>); et 6) l&#x2019;essai Dial-Bicarb comparant les effets d&#x2019;une concentration faible ou &#xe9;lev&#xe9;e de bicarbonate dans le dialysat. Toutes les interventions ont re&#xe7;u de pr&#xe9;cieux commentaires des pan&#xe9;listes et des participants &#xe0; la conf&#xe9;rence, qui les ont largement appuy&#xe9;es. Les s&#xe9;ances de formation ont mis l&#x2019;accent sur les divers &#xe9;l&#xe9;ments de conception et d&#x2019;ex&#xe9;cution des essais contr&#xf4;l&#xe9;s, randomis&#xe9;s, pragmatiques int&#xe9;gr&#xe9;s aux soins courants. La conf&#xe9;rence pourrait &#xea;tre am&#xe9;lior&#xe9;e en all&#xe9;geant les sujets, en acc&#xe9;l&#xe9;rant le rythme des s&#xe9;ances, en laissant plus de temps aux discussions, en augmentant les possibilit&#xe9;s de r&#xe9;seautage en ligne et en am&#xe9;liorant les taux de r&#xe9;ponse aux sondages. Une conf&#xe9;rence de suivi est pr&#xe9;vue dans quelques ann&#xe9;es; les coordinateurs viseront &#xe0; mettre en &#x153;uvre ces changements. La conf&#xe9;rence Gardener&#x2019;s Grove&#x2009;2023 a r&#xe9;ussi &#xe0; cr&#xe9;er un espace o&#xf9; patients, chercheurs et prestataires de soins se sont r&#xe9;unis pour soutenir l&#x2019;&#xe9;laboration de six nouveaux essais pragmatiques dans le contexte des soins d&#x2019;h&#xe9;modialyse. Depuis la conf&#xe9;rence, plusieurs de ces essais ont obtenu du financement des IRSC, obtenu l&#x2019;approbation du comit&#xe9; d&#x2019;&#xe9;thique et se pr&#xe9;parent activement &#xe0; lancer leurs interventions.",

      "abstract": "Better data are necessary to determine whether baseline level of kidney function affects the rate of progressive kidney disease following pregnancy. The objective was to determine whether the baseline (pre-pregnancy) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) modifies the association between becoming pregnant and the subsequent rate of progressive kidney disease. Population-based cohort study using provincial administrative health care databases in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. The sample will be accrued from April 1, 2007, to March 31, 2023, in Ontario and from April 1, 2012, to March 31, 2023, in Alberta. Follow-up for study outcomes will occur until March 31, 2024. The pregnant group will include adult female residents of Ontario or Alberta with a record of a pregnancy of 20 to 46 weeks' gestation during the accrual period, and the non-pregnant group will include adult female residents with no prior record of pregnancy. The cohort entry dates in those in the pregnant group will be the estimated date of conception; the entry dates for those in the non-pregnant group will be randomly assigned following the distribution of dates in the pregnant group. To be eligible, individuals must be between 18 and 45 years old at cohort entry. They require at least 1 serum creatinine measurement within 2 years before entry and should not have received maintenance dialysis or a prior kidney transplant. Both groups will be categorized into one of 3 levels of baseline eGFR (&#x2265;60, 45-59, and &lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Inverse probability of treatment weighting on a propensity score will be used to balance the pregnant and non-pregnant groups on baseline characteristics (including age, proteinuria, hypertension, and diabetes) within the 3 categories of baseline eGFR. The primary outcome, progressive kidney disease, will be defined as a composite of a persistent &#x2265;40% drop in eGFR from the baseline value, a new persistent eGFR &lt;15 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, receipt of maintenance dialysis, or receipt of a kidney transplant. The secondary outcomes will be the components of the primary composite outcome examined separately and the annualized change in eGFR in mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> from baseline. We will test for statistical interaction to determine whether the baseline category of eGFR modifies the rate of long-term progressive kidney disease after pregnancy. We hypothesize that a statistical interaction will be present. We will present weighted cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and cumulative incidence function (CIF) curves for up to 10 years of follow-up for the pregnant and non-pregnant groups stratified by each eGFR category. We will perform additional pre-specified analyses to confirm whether the findings are robust and examine associations that account for baseline proteinuria. Based on a feasibility analysis using ICES data in Ontario, we expect the cohort to include over 400&#x2009;000 pregnant females and 1.2 million non-pregnant females. This includes at least 395&#x2009;000 pregnant females with baseline eGFR &#x2265;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 300 with eGFR 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 110 with eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. The median follow-up is anticipated to be 5 years (range = 1-17 years) with minimal loss to follow-up. Measures of kidney function will be obtained as part of routine care (not according to a research schedule). Measures of baseline proteinuria are frequently missing from routine care data, even in up to 15% of those with an eGFR &lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. This study will investigate whether the level of baseline eGFR modifies the rate of progressive kidney disease after pregnancy and will estimate the cumulative incidence of progressive kidney disease in pregnant and non-pregnant females across 3 categories of baseline eGFR. De meilleures donn&#xe9;es sont n&#xe9;cessaires pour d&#xe9;terminer si le niveau initial de fonction r&#xe9;nale affecte le taux d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale progressive apr&#xe8;s la grossesse. D&#xe9;terminer si le d&#xe9;bit de filtration glom&#xe9;rulaire estim&#xe9; initial (DFGe), soit avant la grossesse, modifie l&#x2019;association entre la grossesse et le taux subs&#xe9;quent (apr&#xe8;s la grossesse) d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale progressive. &#xc9;tude de cohorte repr&#xe9;sentative d&#x2019;une population r&#xe9;alis&#xe9;e &#xe0; partir des donn&#xe9;es administratives de sant&#xe9; provinciales de l&#x2019;Ontario et de l&#x2019;Alberta (Canada). Les sujets des &#xe9;chantillons seront comptabilis&#xe9;s entre le 1<sup>er</sup>&#x2009;avril&#x2009;2007 et le 31&#x2009;mars&#x2009;2023 en Ontario et entre le 1<sup>er</sup>&#x2009;avril&#x2009;2012 et le 31&#x2009;mars&#x2009;2023 en Alberta. Les r&#xe9;sultats de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude seront suivis jusqu&#x2019;au 31&#x2009;mars&#x2009;2024. Le groupe des femmes enceintes regroupera des r&#xe9;sidentes de l&#x2019;Ontario ou de l&#x2019;Alberta dont le dossier indique une grossesse de 20 &#xe0; 46&#x2009;semaines pendant la p&#xe9;riode de cumul de donn&#xe9;es. Le groupe des femmes non enceintes regroupera des sujets aux caract&#xe9;ristiques similaires sans grossesse ant&#xe9;rieure au dossier. Pour les femmes enceintes, la date d&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte sera la date estim&#xe9;e de la conception; les femmes non enceintes se verront attribuer al&#xe9;atoirement une date d&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte en fonction de la r&#xe9;partition des dates dans le groupe des femmes enceintes. Pour &#xea;tre admissibles, les femmes doivent &#xea;tre &#xe2;g&#xe9;es de 18 &#xe0; 45&#x2009;ans au moment de l&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte, avoir au moins une mesure de la cr&#xe9;atinin&#xe9;mie dans les deux ans pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;dant leur inclusion et ne pas avoir re&#xe7;u de dialyse d&#x2019;entretien ou avoir subi de greffe de rein ant&#xe9;rieurement. Les deux groupes seront class&#xe9;s selon trois niveaux de DFGe initial (&#x2265;60, 45 &#xe0; 59 et &lt;45&#x2009;ml/min par 1,73&#x2009;m&#xb2;). La pond&#xe9;ration de la probabilit&#xe9; inverse du traitement sur le score de propension sera utilis&#xe9;e pour &#xe9;quilibrer les groupes de femmes enceintes et non enceintes selon leurs caract&#xe9;ristiques initiales (p. ex., &#xe2;ge, prot&#xe9;inurie, hypertension, diab&#xe8;te) pour les trois niveaux de DFGe initial. Le principal crit&#xe8;re d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation, l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale progressive, a &#xe9;t&#xe9; d&#xe9;fini comme un composite des &#xe9;l&#xe9;ments suivants&#x2009;: r&#xe9;duction persistante d&#x2019;au moins 40&#x2009;% du DFGe par rapport &#xe0; la valeur initiale, DFGe nouvellement &#xe9;tabli &#xe0; &lt; 15&#x2009;ml/min/1,73&#x2009;m&#xb2; de fa&#xe7;on persistante, dialyse d&#x2019;entretien ou transplantation r&#xe9;nale. Les crit&#xe8;res d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation secondaires seront les composantes de ce crit&#xe8;re composite examin&#xe9;es s&#xe9;par&#xe9;ment, de m&#xea;me que la variation annualis&#xe9;e du DFGe (ml/min par 1,73&#x2009;m&#xb2;) par rapport &#xe0; la valeur initiale. Nous testerons l&#x2019;interaction statistique afin de d&#xe9;terminer si le niveau de DFGe initial modifie le taux d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale progressive &#xe0; long terme apr&#xe8;s la grossesse.

Nous proc&#xe9;derons &#xe0; des analyses suppl&#xe9;mentaires pr&#xe9;sp&#xe9;cifi&#xe9;es afin de confirmer la robustesse des r&#xe9;sultats et nous examinerons les associations pouvant expliquer la prot&#xe9;inurie initiale. Une analyse de faisabilit&#xe9; r&#xe9;alis&#xe9;e &#xe0; l&#x2019;aide des donn&#xe9;es du r&#xe9;pertoire de l&#x2019;ICES en Ontario nous permet d&#x2019;estimer que la cohorte comprendra plus de 400&#x2009;000&#x2009;femmes enceintes et 1,2&#x2009;million de femmes non enceintes. La cohorte des femmes enceintes comprendra au moins 395&#x2009;000&#x2009;femmes avec un DFGe initial &#x2265;60&#x2009;ml/min/1,73&#x2009;m&#xb2;, 300 avec un DFGe de 45 &#xe0; 59&#x2009;ml/min/1,73&#x2009;m&#xb2; et 110 avec un DFGe &lt; 45&#x2009;ml/min/1,73&#x2009;m&#xb2;.

      "abstract": "Quantifying the number and proportion of people with kidney failure (KF) who receive conservative kidney management is vital for health care system benchmarking and planning. It is not easy to ascertain this value precisely at the population level, but we can approximate it using information from different data sources to estimate the proportion of patients with advanced kidney disease who die without receiving dialysis or a transplant and should receive conservative kidney management. To approximate the proportion of people with KF in Ontario, Canada, who die without receiving kidney replacement therapy. A review of unpublished provincial renal agency reports of 3 retrospective population-based cohorts combined with clinical interpretation. The 3 cohorts of people were: 1. those who died between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2017, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and no evidence of receiving kidney replacement therapy; 2. those who initiated outpatient maintenance dialysis or received a preemptive transplant in the same period; and 3. those with a sustained low eGFR &#x2264; 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2018, and were followed for 1 year to determine if they started dialysis. In this last cohort, patients whose kidney function improved (evidence of an eGFR &gt; 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) or who received a transplant during follow-up were excluded from the analysis. The 3 cohorts were derived at ICES and used linked health care databases for the province of Ontario, Canada. In 2016, Ontario had a population of about 14 million people. Two nephrologists reviewed the data to provide the clinical approximation. There were 1891 individuals with KF who died without kidney replacement (the no KRT cohort). The median (25th, 75th percentile) eGFR prior to death was 7 (5, 8) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. During the same period, 13&#x2009;511 individuals started dialysis or received a preemptive kidney transplant (the KRT cohort). There were 7259 individuals in the low eGFR cohort; over the following year, 66% started dialysis, 20% died without dialysis, and 14% were alive without starting dialysis. The clinical approximation is that between 13 and 16% of people with KF die without receiving kidney replacement therapy. The data reports lacked certain information to inform the clinical approximation. There was no information on the conversations health professionals had with people about kidney replacement therapy, any decisions made about receiving conservative care, or the circumstances that preceded death without kidney replacement therapy. After reviewing data from the 3 cohorts, we clinically approximate that 1 in 6 people with KF in Ontario, Canada, die without receiving dialysis and should receive conservative kidney management. La quantification du nombre et de la proportion de personnes atteintes d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale (IR) qui re&#xe7;oivent des soins r&#xe9;naux conservateurs est essentielle pour l&#x2019;analyze comparative et la planification dans le syst&#xe8;me de sant&#xe9;. Il n&#x2019;est pas facile de d&#xe9;terminer cette valeur avec pr&#xe9;cision au niveau de la population, mais il est possible de s&#x2019;en approcher en ayant recours aux informations provenant de diff&#xe9;rentes sources de donn&#xe9;es pour estimer la proportion de patients atteints d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale avanc&#xe9;e qui meurent sans avoir re&#xe7;u de dialyze ou de greffe, et qui devraient recevoir des soins r&#xe9;naux conservateurs. Estimer la proportion de personnes atteintes d&#x2019;IR en Ontario (Canada) qui d&#xe9;c&#xe8;dent sans recevoir une th&#xe9;rapie de remplacement r&#xe9;nal. Examen des rapports non publi&#xe9;s de l&#x2019;agence provinciale de la sant&#xe9; r&#xe9;nale de trois cohortes r&#xe9;trospectives bas&#xe9;es sur la population; l&#x2019;examen est combin&#xe9; &#xe0; une interpr&#xe9;tation clinique. Les trois cohortes &#xe9;taient les suivantes: 1. les personnes d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9;es entre le 1<sup>er</sup> janvier 2013 et le 31 d&#xe9;cembre 2017 avec un d&#xe9;bit de filtration glom&#xe9;rulaire estim&#xe9; (DFGe) &lt; 10 ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup> sans preuve de th&#xe9;rapie de remplacement r&#xe9;nal (cohorte sans TRR); 2. les personnes qui ont amorc&#xe9; la dialyze en ambulatoire ou re&#xe7;u une greffe pr&#xe9;ventive au cours de la m&#xea;me p&#xe9;riode (cohorte TRR); 3. les personnes pr&#xe9;sentant de fa&#xe7;on continue un DFGe faible (&#x2264; 10 ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup>) entre le 1<sup>er</sup> avril 2015 et le 31 mars 2018 et qui ont fait l&#x2019;objet d&#x2019;un suivi pendant un an pour savoir si elles avaient ou non amorc&#xe9; la dialyze (cohorte faible DFGe). Dans la troisi&#xe8;me cohorte, les patients dont la fonction r&#xe9;nale s&#x2019;est am&#xe9;lior&#xe9;e (preuves d&#x2019;un DFGe &gt; 10 ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup>) ou qui ont re&#xe7;u une greffe pendant l&#x2019;ann&#xe9;e de suivi ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; exclus de l&#x2019;analyze. Les trois cohortes sont d&#xe9;riv&#xe9;es de l&#x2019;ICES et ont utilis&#xe9; les bases de donn&#xe9;es coupl&#xe9;es du syst&#xe8;me de sant&#xe9; de la province de l&#x2019;Ontario (Canada). En 2016, l&#x2019;Ontario comptait environ 14 millions d&#x2019;habitants. Deux n&#xe9;phrologues ont examin&#xe9; les donn&#xe9;es afin de fournir une approximation clinique. En tout, 1 891 personnes atteintes d&#x2019;IR sont d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9;es sans th&#xe9;rapie de remplacement r&#xe9;nal (cohorte sans TRR). Le DFGe m&#xe9;dian (25<sup>e</sup>, 75<sup>e</sup> percentile) avant le d&#xe9;c&#xe8;s &#xe9;tait de 7 (5, 8) ml/min/1,73 m<sup>2</sup>. Au cours de la m&#xea;me p&#xe9;riode, 13 511 personnes ont amorc&#xe9; la dialyze ou ont re&#xe7;u une greffe r&#xe9;nale pr&#xe9;ventive (cohorte TRR). La cohorte de faible DFGe comptait 7 259 individus; pendant l&#x2019;ann&#xe9;e de suivi, 66 % d&#x2019;entre eux ont amorc&#xe9; la dialyze, 20 % sont d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9;s sans dialyze et 14 % &#xe9;taient vivants, mais n&#x2019;avaient pas amorc&#xe9; la dialyze. Notre approximation clinique est qu&#x2019;entre 13 et 16 % des personnes atteintes d&#x2019;IR meurent sans recevoir une th&#xe9;rapie de remplacement r&#xe9;nal. Les rapports de donn&#xe9;es manquaient de certaines informations qui auraient pu &#xe9;clairer l&#x2019;approximation clinique. Aucune information n&#x2019;&#xe9;tait disponible sur les conversations entre les professionnels de la sant&#xe9; et leurs patients au sujet de la th&#xe9;rapie de remplacement r&#xe9;nal ni sur les d&#xe9;cisions prises quant aux soins r&#xe9;naux conservateurs ni sur les circonstances ayant pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9; un d&#xe9;c&#xe8;s sans th&#xe9;rapie de remplacement r&#xe9;nal. Apr&#xe8;s avoir examin&#xe9; les donn&#xe9;es de ces trois cohortes, notre estimation clinique est qu&#x2019;un Ontarien sur six atteint d&#x2019;IR meurt sans recevoir de dialyze et devrait recevoir des soins r&#xe9;naux conservateurs.",
      "laySummary": "Researchers in Ontario, Canada, estimated that 13-16% of people with kidney failure die without receiving dialysis or a kidney transplant. They analyzed data from three groups of patients with varying kidney function to arrive at this approximation. This is important because it highlights a potential gap in care, suggesting that more patients with advanced kidney disease might benefit from conservative management strategies instead of aggressive treatments."

      "abstract": "In a cluster-randomized trial, we learned that a novel multicomponent intervention designed to improve access to kidney transplantation did not significantly increase the rate of completed steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. Alongside the trial, we conducted a process evaluation to help interpret our findings. To determine whether the intervention addressed targeted barriers to transplant and whether the implementation occurred as planned. Mixed-methods process evaluation informed by implementation science theories. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs in Ontario, Canada. These programs, providing care to patients with advanced CKD, participated in the trial from November 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021 (either in the intervention or usual care group). Health care providers (eg, nurses, managers) at Ontario's 27 CKD programs. We conducted surveys (n = 114/162 [70.4%]) and semi-structured interviews (n = 17/26 [65.4%]) with providers in CKD programs in Ontario, Canada. In both the intervention-group and control-group surveys, using the Theoretical Domains Framework, we assessed perceived barriers to transplant and how barriers changed throughout the trial period. In the intervention-group surveys and interviews, using the normalization process theory, we assessed the extent to which the intervention was embedded into daily routines. In the intervention-group surveys, and by completing an implementation checklist, we assessed fidelity of implementation. Perceived barriers to transplant did not substantially differ between providers in the intervention and usual care groups, and both groups reported disagreeing or feeling neutral that the targeted barriers impeded transplant access. Intervention-group providers reported that intervention activities were becoming a regular part of their work and that they engaged with its components. However, they also felt the intervention was complex and described needing more resources, a better execution plan, and more buy-in from frontline staff. Fidelity was high for administrative support, quality improvement teams, delivery of educational resources, and patient peer support. The use of performance reports was low. We identified several possible reasons why the intervention was unsuccessful. Improving access to kidney transplantation remains a high priority for health care systems. We will continue to foster a quality improvement culture, and our results will guide future interventions. Two of the 13 intervention-group CKD programs did not participate in this evaluation.

Les prestataires de soins de sant&#xe9; (p. ex. personnel infirmier, gestionnaires) qui participent aux 27 programmes d&#x2019;IRC de l&#x2019;Ontario.

      "abstract": "Quality indicators are required to identify gaps in care and to improve equitable access to kidney transplants. Referral to a transplant center for an evaluation is the first step toward receiving a kidney transplant, yet widespread reporting on this metric is lacking. The objective was to use administrative health care databases to examine multiple ways to define referral for a kidney transplant evaluation by varying clinical inclusion criteria, definitions for end of follow-up, and statistical methodologies. This is a population-based cohort study. This study linked administrative health care databases in Ontario, Canada. Adults from Ontario, Canada, with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) between April 1, 2017, and March 31, 2018. The primary outcome was the 1-year cumulative incidence of kidney transplant referral. We created several patient cohort definitions, varying patient transplant eligibility by health status (eg, whether patients had a recorded contraindication to transplant). We presented results by advanced CKD status (ie, patients approaching the need for dialysis vs receiving maintenance dialysis) and by method of cohort entry (ie, incident only vs prevalent and incident patients combined), resulting in 12 unique cohorts. Sample size varied substantially from 414 to 4128 depending on the patient cohort definition, with the largest reduction in cohort size occurring when we restricted to a \"healthy\" (eg, no evidence of cardiovascular disease) group of patients. The 1-year cumulative incidence of transplant referral varied widely across cohorts. For example, in the incident maintenance dialysis population, the cumulative incidence varied more than 2-fold from 16.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 15.0%-17.7%) using our most inclusive cohort definition to 40.0% (95% CI = 36.0%-44.5%) using our most restrictive \"healthy\" cohort of patients. Administrative data may have misclassified individuals' eligibility for kidney transplant. These results can be used by jurisdictions to measure transplant referral, a necessary step in kidney transplantation that is not equitable for all patients. Adoption of these indicators should drive quality improvement efforts that increase the number of patients referred for transplantation and ensure equitable access for all patient groups. Des indicateurs de qualit&#xe9; sont n&#xe9;cessaires pour r&#xe9;v&#xe9;ler les lacunes dans les soins et favoriser l&#x2019;acc&#xe8;s &#xe9;quitable aux greffes de rein. L&#x2019;aiguillage dans un centre de transplantation pour une &#xe9;valuation est la premi&#xe8;re &#xe9;tape vers la greffe de rein, mais il n&#x2019;existe pas de rapports &#xe0; grande &#xe9;chelle sur cette mesure.

Bases de donn&#xe9;es administratives coupl&#xe9;es du syst&#xe8;me de sant&#xe9; ontarien (Canada). Adultes (Ontario, Canada) atteints d&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale chronique (IRC) de stade avanc&#xe9; entre le 1<sup>er</sup> avril 2017 et le 31 mars 2018. Le principal crit&#xe8;re d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation &#xe9;tait l&#x2019;incidence cumul&#xe9;e sur un an d&#x2019;aiguillage vers un centre de transplantation r&#xe9;nale. Nous avons cr&#xe9;&#xe9; plusieurs d&#xe9;finitions de cohortes de patients en faisant varier l&#x2019;admissibilit&#xe9; &#xe0; la transplantation selon l&#x2019;&#xe9;tat de sant&#xe9; (p. ex., patients avec ou sans contre-indication consign&#xe9;e &#xe0; la transplantation). Nous avons pr&#xe9;sent&#xe9; les r&#xe9;sultats selon la gravit&#xe9; de l&#x2019;IRC (patients approchant le besoin de dialyse par rapport &#xe0; ceux qui recevaient une dialyse d&#x2019;entretien) et selon la m&#xe9;thode d&#x2019;entr&#xe9;e dans la cohorte (patients incidents seulement par rapport aux patients &#xe0; la fois pr&#xe9;valents et incidents), ce qui s&#x2019;est traduit par douze cohortes uniques. La taille des &#xe9;chantillons variait consid&#xe9;rablement selon la d&#xe9;finition de la cohorte (de 414 &#xe0; 4 128 individus), la plus importante r&#xe9;duction de taille de cohorte s&#x2019;&#xe9;tant produite lorsque nous nous sommes limit&#xe9;s &#xe0; un groupe de patients &#xab; en bonne sant&#xe9; &#xbb; (p. ex., sans preuve de maladie cardiovasculaire). L&#x2019;incidence cumul&#xe9;e sur un an d&#x2019;aiguillage vers un centre de transplantation variait consid&#xe9;rablement d&#x2019;une cohorte &#xe0; l&#x2019;autre.

      "abstract": "Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is the most prevalent vascular complication following surgical procedures. Although the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) is widely used to predict postoperative cardiovascular complications, its predictive accuracy is suboptimal. Considering genetic influences may improve risk prediction. The authors propose integrating polygenic risk scores (PRS) with the RCRI to enhance MINS prediction. Identification of PRS associated with MINS could provide pathophysiological insights. This is a case-control study nested within the Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Participants Cohort Evaluation cohort, including patients aged 45 and above who underwent noncardiac surgery. Daily troponin levels were measured preoperatively and on days 1, 2, and 3 postoperatively. PRS was computed for MINS risk factors using publicly available summary statistics. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between each PRS and MINS. PRS discrimination was assessed independently and in combination with RCRI. A total of 253 MINS cases were matched with 253 controls, adjusted for age, sex, and limited to individuals of European ancestry (n<sub>total</sub>&#xa0;=&#xa0;506). The type II diabetes (T2D) PRS (OR:&#xa0;1.26; 95%&#xa0;CI: 1.00-1.58; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.047) and the HbA1c PRS (OR:&#xa0;1.26; 95%&#xa0;CI: 1.03-1.54; P&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.026) were associated with MINS. No other PRS, including those for coronary artery disease, stroke, and lipid biomarkers, showed significant associations. The T2D PRS and the HbA1c PRS were associated with an increased risk of MINS. The findings may&#xa0;reflect the multifactorial pathophysiology of MINS. Larger genetic studies and trials evaluating perioperative glucose management warrant consideration.",

      "abstract": "Some men who donate a kidney have reported testicular pain after donation; however, attribution to donation is not clear as no prior studies included a comparison group of nondonors. To examine the proportion of male donors who reported testicular pain in the years after nephrectomy compared to male nondonors with similar baseline health characteristics. We enrolled 1042 living kidney donors (351 male) before nephrectomy from 17 transplant centers (12 in Canada and 5 in Australia) from 2004 to 2014. A concurrent sample of 396 nondonors (126 male) was enrolled. Follow-up occurred until November 2021. Donors and nondonors completed the same schedule of measurements at baseline (before nephrectomy) and follow-up. During follow-up, participants completed a questionnaire asking whether they had experienced new pain in their eyes, hands, or testicles; those who experienced pain were asked to indicate on which side of the body the pain occurred (left or right). The pain questionnaire was completed by 290 of 351 male donors (83%) and 97 of 126 male nondonors (77%) a median of 3 years after baseline (interquartile range = 2-6). Inverse probability of treatment weighting on a propensity score was used to balance donors and nondonors on baseline characteristics. After weighting, the nondonor sample increased to a pseudo sample of 295, and most baseline characteristics were similar between donors and nondonors. At baseline, donors (n = 290) were a mean age of 49 years; 83% were employed, and 80% were married; 246 (84.8%) underwent laparoscopic surgery and 44 (15.2%) open surgery; 253 (87.2%) had a left-sided nephrectomy and 37 (12.8%) a right-sided nephrectomy. In the weighted analysis, the risk of testicular pain was significantly greater among donors than nondonors: 51/290 (17.6%) vs 7/295 (2.3%); weighted risk ratio, 7.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7 to 22.8). Donors and nondonors did not differ statistically in terms of self-reported eye pain or hand pain. Among donors, the occurrence of testicular pain was most often unilateral (92.2%) and on the same side as the nephrectomy (90.2%). Testicular pain occurred more often in donors who had laparoscopic vs open surgery: 48/246 (19.5%) vs 3/44 (6.8%) but was similar in those who had a left-sided vs right-sided nephrectomy: 44/253 (17.4%) vs 7/37 (18.9%). Participants recalled their symptoms several years after baseline, and we did not assess the timing, severity, or duration of pain or any treatments received for the pain. Unilateral testicular pain on the same side of a nephrectomy is a potential complication of living kidney donation that warrants further investigation. Des hommes qui avaient fait don d&#x2019;un rein ont rapport&#xe9; l&#x2019;apparition de douleurs testiculaires apr&#xe8;s le don. Le lien entre le don et ces douleurs n&#x2019;est cependant pas clair, car aucune &#xe9;tude ant&#xe9;rieure n&#x2019;a inclus un groupe t&#xe9;moin constitu&#xe9; de non-donneurs. Examiner la proportion de donneurs masculins qui ont signal&#xe9; une douleur testiculaire dans les ann&#xe9;es suivant la n&#xe9;phrectomie par rapport &#xe0; des non-donneurs pr&#xe9;sentant des caract&#xe9;ristiques initiales similaires en mati&#xe8;re de sant&#xe9;. Nous avons recrut&#xe9; 1 042 donneurs vivants d&#x2019;un rein (351 hommes) avant la n&#xe9;phrectomie dans 17 centres de transplantation (12 au Canada et 5 en Australie) entre 2004 et 2014. Un &#xe9;chantillon simultan&#xe9; de 396 non-donneurs (126 hommes) a &#xe9;t&#xe9; constitu&#xe9;. Le suivi s&#x2019;est poursuivi jusqu&#x2019;en novembre 2021. Les donneurs et les non-donneurs ont suivi le m&#xea;me programme de mesures au d&#xe9;but de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude (avant la n&#xe9;phrectomie) et au cours du suivi. Pendant la p&#xe9;riode du suivi, les sujets ont r&#xe9;pondu &#xe0; un questionnaire portant sur l&#x2019;apparition d&#x2019;une nouvelle douleur aux yeux, aux mains ou aux testicules; les personnes qui avaient ressenti une douleur devaient pr&#xe9;ciser de quel c&#xf4;t&#xe9; (gauche ou droit). Le questionnaire sur la douleur a &#xe9;t&#xe9; rempli par 290 des 351 donneurs (83 %) et par 97 des 126 non-donneurs (77 %), environ 3 ans (m&#xe9;diane; intervalle interquartile: 2, 6) apr&#xe8;s leur inclusion &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude. La pond&#xe9;ration de la probabilit&#xe9; inverse de traitement sur un score de propension a &#xe9;t&#xe9; employ&#xe9;e pour &#xe9;quilibrer les donneurs et les non-donneurs selon leurs caract&#xe9;ristiques initiales. Apr&#xe8;s pond&#xe9;ration, l&#x2019;&#xe9;chantillon des non-donneurs s&#x2019;est &#xe9;largi et est pass&#xe9; &#xe0; un pseudo&#xe9;chantillon de 295 sujets; la plupart des caract&#xe9;ristiques initiales &#xe9;taient similaires entre les donneurs et les non-donneurs. Les donneurs (n=290) &#xe9;taient &#xe2;g&#xe9;s de 49 ans en moyenne au d&#xe9;but de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude; 83 % occupaient un emploi et 80 % &#xe9;taient mari&#xe9;s; 246 donneurs (84 %) avaient subi une chirurgie par laparoscopie et 44 (15,2 %) une chirurgie ouverte; 253 donneurs (87 %) avaient subi une n&#xe9;phrectomie du c&#xf4;t&#xe9; gauche et 37 (12,8 %) du c&#xf4;t&#xe9; droit. Dans l&#x2019;analyse pond&#xe9;r&#xe9;e, le risque de souffrir de douleurs testiculaires &#xe9;tait significativement plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9; chez les donneurs que chez les non-donneurs: 51/290 (17,6 %) c. 7/295 (2,3 %), avec un risque relatif pond&#xe9;r&#xe9; de 7,8 (IC &#xe0; 95 %: 2,7 &#xe0; 22,8). Aucune diff&#xe9;rence statistique n&#x2019;a &#xe9;t&#xe9; observ&#xe9;e entre les deux groupes pour les taux de douleurs autod&#xe9;clar&#xe9;es aux yeux ou aux mains. Les donneurs qui ont signal&#xe9; des douleurs testiculaires la ressentaient le plus souvent de fa&#xe7;on unilat&#xe9;rale (92 %) et du m&#xea;me c&#xf4;t&#xe9; que la n&#xe9;phrectomie (90 %). Les douleurs testiculaires sont survenues plus souvent chez ceux qui avaient subi une chirurgie par laparoscopie que par chirurgie ouverte (48/246 [19,5 %] c. 3/44 [6,8 %]), mais a &#xe9;t&#xe9; ressentie de fa&#xe7;on similaire que la n&#xe9;phrectomie ait eu lieu &#xe0; droite ou &#xe0; gauche: 44/253 (17,4 %) c. 7/37 (18,9 %). Les sujets ont d&#xfb; se souvenir de leurs sympt&#xf4;mes plusieurs ann&#xe9;es apr&#xe8;s le d&#xe9;but de l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude. Nous n&#x2019;avons pas &#xe9;valu&#xe9; le moment, la gravit&#xe9; ou la dur&#xe9;e de la douleur ni les traitements re&#xe7;us pour la soulager. L&#x2019;apparition d&#x2019;une douleur testiculaire ressentie unilat&#xe9;ralement du m&#xea;me c&#xf4;t&#xe9; que la n&#xe9;phrectomie est une possible complication du don vivant d&#x2019;un rein qui justifie une investigation plus approfondie.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at whether men who donate a kidney experience testicular pain after the donation. Researchers found that living kidney donors were significantly more likely to report testicular pain compared to men who didn't donate a kidney, and the pain was often on the same side as the removed kidney. This suggests that testicular pain could be a potential complication of living kidney donation that needs further study."

      "abstract": "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization in patients receiving maintenance dialysis is unclear. To compare the rates of clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization in patients receiving maintenance dialysis (in-center and home modalities) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Population-based, repeated cross-sectional study. Linked administrative healthcare databases from Ontario, Canada. Adults receiving maintenance dialysis from March 15, 2017, to March 14, 2020 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic period) and from March 15, 2020, to March 14, 2023 (COVID-19 pandemic period). Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included non-COVID-19-related mortality, all-cause hospitalizations (excluding elective surgeries), emergency room visits, intensive care unit admissions, and hospital admissions with mechanical ventilation. We also examined cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, kidney-related outcomes, and ambulatory visits. We used Poisson generalized estimating equations to model pre-COVID outcome trends and used these to predict post-COVID outcomes and to estimate the relative change (i.e., the ratio of the observed to the expected rate). In 31&#x2009;900 individuals receiving maintenance dialysis during the study period, the crude incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) of all-cause mortality was 165.0 in the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 173.2 during the first year of the pandemic and 171.7 during the first 36 months of the pandemic. After adjustment, there was a statistically significant increase in all-cause mortality in 14 out of the 36 months of the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, with 494 recorded COVID-19-related deaths. However, when examining the overall all-cause mortality across the months, the adjusted relative rate (aRR) comparing the observed to expected all-cause mortality rate was not statistically significant in the first year of the pandemic (1.08, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.16) and the first 36 months of the pandemic (1.08, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.18) compared to the pre-pandemic period. The crude incidence rate of non-COVID-19-related mortality was 165.0 in the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 163.3 during the first year of the pandemic and 157.7 during the first 36 months. After adjustment, there was no substantial change in the rate of non-COVID-19-related deaths in the first year of the pandemic (aRR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.09), but there was a substantial decrease in all-cause hospitalization, with an aRR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.97), and a substantial decrease in emergency room visits and intensive care unit admissions; findings were consistent 36 months into the pandemic. External generalizability to other jurisdictions may be limited, with each region experiencing different COVID-19 rates and implementing different mitigation strategies. In the maintenance dialysis population, all-cause mortality was significantly higher during several months of the pandemic; however, the overall rate of all-cause mortality was not substantially higher than expected in the first 36 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no substantial increase in non-COVID-19-related mortality despite a substantial decrease in acute healthcare utilization. Ongoing monitoring of the dialysis population will offer further insights into the long-term effects of the pandemic. On conna&#xee;t mal les cons&#xe9;quences de la pand&#xe9;mie de COVID-19 sur les r&#xe9;sultats cliniques des patients recevant une dialyse d&#x2019;entretien et sur leur utilisation des soins de sant&#xe9;. Comparer les taux d&#x2019;utilisation des soins de sant&#xe9; et les r&#xe9;sultats cliniques des patients recevant une dialyse d&#x2019;entretien (en centre et &#xe0; domicile) avant et pendant la pand&#xe9;mie de COVID-19. &#xc9;tude populationnelle transversale r&#xe9;p&#xe9;t&#xe9;e. Les bases de donn&#xe9;es coupl&#xe9;es du syst&#xe8;me de sant&#xe9; de l&#x2019;Ontario (Canada). Les adultes recevant une dialyse d&#x2019;entretien entre le 15 mars 2017 et le 14 mars 2020 (p&#xe9;riode pr&#xe9;-pand&#xe9;mie de COVID-19) ainsi que du 15 mars 2020 au 14 mars 2023 (p&#xe9;riode pand&#xe9;mique). Notre principal crit&#xe8;re de jugement &#xe9;tait la mortalit&#xe9; toutes causes confondues. Nos crit&#xe8;res de jugement secondaires comprenaient les d&#xe9;c&#xe8;s non li&#xe9;s &#xe0; la COVID-19, les hospitalisations toutes causes confondues (&#xe0; l&#x2019;exclusion des chirurgies &#xe9;lectives), les visites aux urgences, les admissions aux soins intensifs et les admissions &#xe0; l&#x2019;h&#xf4;pital avec ventilation m&#xe9;canique. Nous avons aussi examin&#xe9; les hospitalisations li&#xe9;es aux maladies cardiovasculaires, les r&#xe9;sultats li&#xe9;s &#xe0; la fonction r&#xe9;nale et les visites ambulatoires. Nous avons utilis&#xe9; des &#xe9;quations d&#x2019;estimation g&#xe9;n&#xe9;ralis&#xe9;es de Poisson pour mod&#xe9;liser les tendances dans les r&#xe9;sultats pr&#xe9;-COVID et nous avons utilis&#xe9; celles-ci pour pr&#xe9;dire les r&#xe9;sultats post-COVID et estimer la variation relative (c.-&#xe0;-d., le ratio entre le taux observ&#xe9; et le taux attendu). Chez les 31 900 personnes qui recevaient une dialyse d&#x2019;entretien au cours de la p&#xe9;riode &#xe9;tudi&#xe9;e, le taux d&#x2019;incidence brut (pour 1 000 personnes-ann&#xe9;es) de mortalit&#xe9; toutes causes confondues &#xe9;tait de 165,0 au cours de la p&#xe9;riode pr&#xe9;-COVID-19, comparativement &#xe0; 173,2 dans la premi&#xe8;re ann&#xe9;e de la pand&#xe9;mie et &#xe0; 171,7 pendant les 36 premiers mois de la pand&#xe9;mie. Apr&#xe8;s correction, on a observ&#xe9; une augmentation statistiquement significative de la mortalit&#xe9; toutes causes confondues pour 14 des 36 mois de la pand&#xe9;mie par rapport &#xe0; la p&#xe9;riode pr&#xe9;-COVID-19, avec 494 d&#xe9;c&#xe8;s enregistr&#xe9;s en lien avec la COVID-19. Cependant, lors de l&#x2019;examen de la mortalit&#xe9; globale toutes causes confondues au fil des mois, le risque relatif corrig&#xe9; (RRc) comparant les taux observ&#xe9; et attendu de mortalit&#xe9; toutes causes confondues n&#x2019;&#xe9;tait pas statistiquement significatif au cours de la premi&#xe8;re ann&#xe9;e de la pand&#xe9;mie (RRc: 1,08; IC &#xe0; 95 %: 1,00-1,16) et des 36 premiers mois de la pand&#xe9;mie (RRc: 1,08; IC &#xe0; 95 %: 0,99-1,18) par rapport &#xe0; la p&#xe9;riode pr&#xe9;-pand&#xe9;mie. Le taux d&#x2019;incidence brut de mortalit&#xe9; non li&#xe9;e &#xe0; la COVID-19 &#xe9;tait de 165,0 dans la p&#xe9;riode pr&#xe9;-COVID-19, contre 163,3 au cours de la premi&#xe8;re ann&#xe9;e de la pand&#xe9;mie et 157,7 au cours des 36 premiers mois. Apr&#xe8;s correction, aucun changement important n&#x2019;a &#xe9;t&#xe9; observ&#xe9; dans le taux de d&#xe9;c&#xe8;s non li&#xe9;s &#xe0; la COVID-19 dans la premi&#xe8;re ann&#xe9;e de la pand&#xe9;mie (RRc: 1,01; IC &#xe0; 95 %: 0,94-1,09), mais une diminution substantielle a &#xe9;t&#xe9; observ&#xe9;e dans les hospitalisations toutes causes confondues, avec un taux de 0,92 (IC &#xe0; 95 %: 0,88-0,97), ainsi que dans les visites aux urgences et les admissions aux soins intensifs; ces r&#xe9;sultats &#xe9;taient constants 36 mois apr&#xe8;s le d&#xe9;but de la pand&#xe9;mie. La g&#xe9;n&#xe9;ralisabilit&#xe9; externe &#xe0; d&#x2019;autres provinces est limit&#xe9;e, chaque r&#xe9;gion ayant connu des taux de COVID-19 diff&#xe9;rents et ayant mis en &#x153;uvre des strat&#xe9;gies d&#x2019;att&#xe9;nuation diff&#xe9;rentes. Dans la population sous dialyse d&#x2019;entretien, la mortalit&#xe9; toutes causes confondues &#xe9;tait significativement plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9;e pendant plusieurs mois au cours de la pand&#xe9;mie. Cependant, le taux global de mortalit&#xe9; toutes causes confondues n&#x2019;a pas &#xe9;t&#xe9; plus &#xe9;lev&#xe9; que pr&#xe9;vu au cours des 36 premiers mois de la pand&#xe9;mie de COVID-19. La mortalit&#xe9; non li&#xe9;e &#xe0; la COVID-19 n&#x2019;a pas augment&#xe9; de fa&#xe7;on substantielle, malgr&#xe9; une importante diminution de l&#x2019;utilisation des soins de sant&#xe9; aigus. La surveillance continue de cette population permettra de mieux comprendre les effets &#xe0; long terme de la pand&#xe9;mie.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how the COVID-19 pandemic affected people receiving regular dialysis. Researchers found that while there was a rise in deaths during some months of the pandemic, the overall risk of death remained similar to what was expected before the pandemic. However, hospitalizations and emergency room visits significantly decreased during the pandemic, suggesting less overall healthcare use. This highlights the complex and varied impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations."

      "abstract": "Tracking the evaluation process of living kidney donor candidates facilitates benchmarking and can inform process redesign to improve experiences with the evaluation and enable more living donor kidney transplantation. We reviewed the medical records for all living donor candidates who were actively undergoing evaluation at any time between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, at the London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario, Canada. We abstracted information on demographic factors, the evaluation process, reasons for a delayed evaluation, reasons for an evaluation termination (eg, donation, decline, withdrawal, loss to follow-up), frequency and timing of evaluation testing, and recipient dialysis status. Over time, the number of living donor kidney transplants increased from 22 in 2013 to 32 in 2016 (18% and 34% of which were pre-emptive, respectively). The median number of candidates coming forward doubled from 167 in 2013 (2 candidates per recipient) to 348 in 2016 (4 candidates per recipient). Median time from first contact until donation decreased from 12.8 months in 2013 to 7.1 months in 2016 (a 45% reduction). The time from computed tomography (CT) angiography until donation (n = 74) was a median of 75 (interquartile range [IQR] = 36, 180) days, the longest single step in the evaluation. Common reasons for delay included waiting for the referral of their intended recipient for transplant evaluation (11% of candidates) and a need for the donor candidate to lose weight (8% of candidates). Donors completed the main evaluation tests on a median of 5 different dates. Thirty-six recipients started dialysis after their living donor candidates' evaluation had been underway for at least 3 months. Tracking the steps and reasons for an inefficient living kidney donor evaluation process can be used for quality improvement, and efficiency improvements are expected to translate into improved outcomes and experiences. Le suivi du processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation des candidats au don de rein vivant facilite l&#x2019;analyse comparative et peut guider la refonte du processus afin d&#x2019;am&#xe9;liorer l&#x2019;exp&#xe9;rience d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation et d&#x2019;augmenter le taux de transplantation de reins provenant de donneurs vivants. Nous avons examin&#xe9; les dossiers m&#xe9;dicaux de tous les candidats au don de rein vivant qui, entre le 1<sup>er</sup> janvier 2013 et le 31 d&#xe9;cembre 2016, faisaient l&#x2019;objet d&#x2019;une &#xe9;valuation active au London Health Sciences Centre de London, en Ontario (Canada). Nous avons extrait les donn&#xe9;es sur les facteurs d&#xe9;mographiques, le processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation, les raisons d&#x2019;une &#xe9;valuation retard&#xe9;e, les raisons de l&#x2019;arr&#xea;t de l&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation (p. ex., don, refus, retrait, perte de suivi), la fr&#xe9;quence et le moment des tests d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation et la situation de dialyse du receveur. Au fil du temps, le nombre de greffes de rein provenant de donneurs vivants est pass&#xe9; de 22 en 2013 &#xe0; 32 en 2016 (dont respectivement 18 % et 34 % de greffes pr&#xe9;ventives). Le nombre m&#xe9;dian de candidats a doubl&#xe9;, passant de 167 en 2013 (deux candidats par receveur) &#xe0; 348 en 2016 (quatre candidats par receveur). Le temps m&#xe9;dian &#xe9;coul&#xe9; entre le premier contact et le don a diminu&#xe9;, passant de 12,8 mois en 2013 &#xe0; 7,1 mois en 2016 (r&#xe9;duction de 45 %). Le nombre m&#xe9;dian de jours entre l&#x2019;angiographie par tomodensitom&#xe9;trie et le don (n=74) &#xe9;tait de 75 jours (IIQ: 36, 180), ce qui constitue l&#x2019;&#xe9;tape la plus longue du processus d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation. Les raisons les plus souvent invoqu&#xe9;es pour expliquer un retard &#xe9;taient l&#x2019;attente pour l&#x2019;aiguillage du receveur pr&#xe9;vu vers son &#xe9;valuation pour la greffe (11 % des candidats) et la n&#xe9;cessit&#xe9; pour le candidat au don de perdre du poids avant l&#x2019;intervention (8 % des candidats). Les donneurs ont pass&#xe9; les principaux tests d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation &#xe0; cinq dates diff&#xe9;rentes en moyenne. Trente-six receveurs avaient amorc&#xe9; la dialyse alors que l&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation de leur candidat au don vivant &#xe9;tait en cours depuis au moins trois mois. Le suivi des &#xe9;tapes d&#x2019;un processus inefficace d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation des donneurs vivants de rein, ainsi que des raisons expliquant son efficacit&#xe9;, peut contribuer &#xe0; l&#x2019;am&#xe9;lioration de la qualit&#xe9;. Ces am&#xe9;liorations entra&#xee;neront une plus grande efficacit&#xe9; qui devrait se traduire par de meilleurs r&#xe9;sultats et de meilleures exp&#xe9;riences.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how long it took people to go through the process of becoming a living kidney donor in Ontario, Canada, between 2013 and 2016. Researchers found that the number of potential donors and successful transplants increased during this time, with the overall evaluation process becoming more efficient.  The longest step in the evaluation was typically waiting for a CT scan, and common delays involved waiting for the recipient's transplant evaluation or needing the donor to lose weight."

      "abstract": "This real-world study involved a large cohort of 38,598 adults with atrial fibrillation from five jurisdictions across Australia and Canada. This study supports the use of apixaban as a safe and effective alternative to warfarin for atrial fibrillation across differing levels of kidney function. This study also adds important safety data on the use of apixaban in patients with reduced kidney function. Evidence to guide the use of apixaban in people with atrial fibrillation (AF) and CKD in routine clinical practice has been limited. We assessed comparative safety (major bleeding) and effectiveness (ischemic stroke and death) of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with AF across the spectrum of non&#x2013;dialysis-dependent CKD using large, routinely collected data. We combined findings from five retrospective cohorts (2013&#x2013;2018) across Australia and Canada. Adults with AF, new dispensation of apixaban or warfarin, and a recorded eGFR grouped as &#x2265;60, 45&#x2013;59, 30&#x2013;44, and &lt;30 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were included. Patients on dialysis or kidney transplant recipients were excluded. We assessed outcomes within 1 year of initiating either therapy: (<i>1</i>) composite of all-cause death, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack and (<i>2</i>) first hospitalization for major bleeding (intracranial, gastrointestinal, or other). Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs; 95% confidence intervals) for outcomes across eGFR categories, after 1:1 matching using propensity scores. We summarized center-level data using random effects meta-analysis. Among 38,598 matched apixaban and warfarin users, there were 4130 (10.7%) ischemic and 697 (1.8%) bleeding events within 1 year. Apixaban was associated with lower or similar risk for the ischemic outcome compared with warfarin in all eGFR categories (pooled HRs [95% confidence interval]: 0.78 [0.64 to 0.94], 0.77 [0.62 to 0.97], 0.82 [0.68 to 0.98], and 0.99 [0.68 to 1.45] for eGFR &#x2265;60, 45&#x2013;59, 30&#x2013;44, and &lt;30 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Apixaban was associated with lower or similar risk of bleeding across the range of kidney function (pooled HRs: 0.55 [0.43 to 0.69], 0.73 [0.52 to 1.02], 0.55 [0.31 to 0.97], and 0.68 [0.47 to 0.99], respectively). There was no significant heterogeneity across jurisdictions or eGFR categories. In adults with AF and non&#x2013;dialysis-dependent CKD, apixaban compared with warfarin was associated with lower or similar risk of ischemic and bleeding outcomes. Our results suggest that apixaban offers a favorable risk-benefit ratio in patients with AF independent of kidney function.",

      "abstract": "Optimal anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation is unclear. Effect of left atrial appendage occlusion may differ in these patients. We conducted a secondary analysis of the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS III) to investigate METHODS: LAAOS III randomized 4,811 participants with atrial fibrillation undergoing cardiac surgery. Baseline serum creatinine measurement was available for 4,768 participants (99.9%). We estimated the Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease -Epidemiology Collaboration equation. We investigated the effect of left atrial appendage occlusion using Cox-proportional hazards model with baseline kidney function as continuous and categorical variables. Among 4,768 participants, 67.5% were men and the median age was 71.2 years. Occluding the left atrial appendage demonstrated similar effects after adjusting for eGFR; occlusion was associated with significant reduced risk of stroke compared to no occlusion (HR0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85, P = .001). There was no difference in all-cause mortality (HR0.99, 95% CI 0.88-1.12, P = .88), cardiovascular deaths (HR0.93, 95% CI 0.80-1.09, P = .36), hospitalizations for heart failure (HR1.13, 95% CI 0.91-1.39, P = 0.27), major bleeding (HR0.92, 95% CI 0.78-1.10, P = .37), and myocardial infarction (HR0.86, 95% CI 0.59-1.27, P = .45). The P-value for interaction for eGFR was not significant for any outcome. The effects of surgical left atrial appendage occlusion in participants with impaired kidney function was consistent with findings from LAAOS III. Left atrial appendage occlusion was associated with reduced stroke without increased risk of serious adverse events.

      "abstract": "Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is associated with increased perioperative mortality; however, the incidence and prognostic impact of MINS after major head and neck surgery remains uncertain. To determine the incidence and clinical implications of MINS in patients after major head and neck surgery. This cohort study used data from the VISION (Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation; 2017) study, an international prospective cohort study that analyzed more than 35&#x202f;000 patients who had noncardiac surgery. Of those, 648 patients (1.8%) underwent major head and neck surgery requiring at least 1-day hospital admission and screening for MINS via troponin T (TnT) concentrations measured during the first 3 postoperative days. MINS was defined as a high-sensitivity TnT (hsTnT) of 20 to 64 ng/L and absolute change more than 5 ng/L or hsTnT 65 ng/L or greater (ie, fifth-generation assay) and cardiac ischemia. When using fourth-generation assay, MINS was defined as non-hsTNT 0.04 ng/mL or greater and cardiac ischemia. Data analyses were performed from October to December 2024. MINS incidence and its association with 30-day mortality. All clinical outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression models and length of hospital stay (LOHS) was analyzed using multivariable linear regression. Among 648 patients (265 [40.9%] female and 383 [59.1%] male; 376 [58.0%] aged 45 to 64 years), the incidence of MINS after major head and neck surgery was 11.9% (95% CI, 9.39%-14.4%), rising to 23.8% (95% CI, 15.7%-32%) among those aged 75 years or older. MINS occurred more often in patients with medical comorbidities. The proportion of MINS that would have gone undetected without TnT monitoring was 68.8% (95% CI, 57.3%-78.9%). In this cohort, 30-day and 1-year mortality were 1.9% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.9%) and 13.1% (95% CI, 10.5%-15.7%), respectively. MINS was associated with increased 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 5.51; 95% CI, 1.75-17.36) and prolonged LOHS in patients with MINS with at least 1 ischemic feature (adjusted &#x3b2;, 3.15 days; 95% CI, 1.47-6.76 days). This cohort study found that myocardial injury was common among patients undergoing major head and neck surgery, especially those aged 75 years or older and those with comorbidities. Nearly 70% of MINS cases go undetected without TnT monitoring, and MINS may contribute to worse 30-day postoperative mortality and prolonged LOHS. Further prospective validation is needed to evaluate the role of MINS screening in improving clinical outcomes after major head and neck surgery.",
      "laySummary": "This study found that heart damage (myocardial injury) is more common than previously thought in patients recovering from major head and neck surgery, particularly in older adults and those with other health problems.  Importantly, most cases of this heart damage go undetected without specific blood tests, and it's linked to a higher risk of death and longer hospital stays after surgery.  This suggests that doctors should consider monitoring heart health after these types of procedures to improve patient outcomes."

      "abstract": "Post-cancer therapy kidney outcomes, including chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, are common in childhood cancer survivors (CCS). The incidence and timing of CKD and hypertension in CCS compared with other at-risk or general populations are unclear. To determine the association of childhood cancer treatment with post-cancer therapy CKD or hypertension. Population-based matched cohort study of children treated for cancer between April 1993 and March 2020 in Ontario, Canada, with follow-up until March 2021. The CCS (exposed) cohort included children (&#x2264;18 years) surviving cancer. Comparator cohorts were a hospitalization cohort (children who were hospitalized) and a general pediatric population (GP) cohort (all other Ontario children). Exclusion criteria were history of previous cancer, organ transplant, CKD, dialysis, or hypertension. Matching with each of the 2 comparator cohorts was performed separately and in a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, rural vs urban status, income quintile, index year, and presence of previous hospitalization. Data were analyzed from March 2021 to August 2024. Treatment for cancer. The primary outcome was the composite of CKD or hypertension, defined by administrative health care diagnosis and procedure codes. Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard modeling, accounting for competing risks (death and new cancer diagnosis or relapse) and adjusting for cardiac disease, liver disease, and diabetes, was used to determine the association of cancer treatment with outcomes. There were 10&#x202f;182 CCS (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 7 [3-13] years; 5529 male [54.3%]; median [IQR] follow-up time, 8 [2-15] years) matched to 40&#x202f;728 hospitalization cohort patients (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 7 [2-12] years; 5529 male [weighted percentage, 54.3%]; median [IQR] follow-up time, 11 [6-18] years) and 8849 CCS (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 5 [2-11] years; 4825 male [54.5%]; median [IQR] follow-up time, 7 [2-14] years) matched to 35&#x202f;307 GP cohort individuals (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 6 [2-11] years; 4825 male [weighted percentage, 54.5%]; median [IQR] follow-up time, 10 [5-16] years). Most frequent cancer types were leukemia (2948 patients [29.0%]), central nervous system neoplasms (2123 patients [20.9%]), and lymphoma (1583 patients [15.5%]). During observation, cumulative incidence of CKD or hypertension was 20.85% (95% CI, 18.75%-23.02%) in the CCS cohort vs 16.47% (95% CI, 15.21%-17.77%) in the hospitalization cohort and 19.24% (95% CI, 15.99%-22.73%) in the CCS cohort vs 8.05% (95% CI, 6.76%-9.49%) in the GP cohort. CCS were at increased risk of CKD or hypertension compared with the hospitalization cohort (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.86-2.14; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and the GP cohort (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% CI, 4.27-5.19; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001).

      "abstract": "Patients with AKI experience higher rates of heart failure (HF). This study seeks to identify criteria to assess the risk of heart failure post-hospitalization, with a special focus on AKI patients. We hypothesized that the combined use of 9 vascular biomarkers would predict future heart failure events after AKI. Using a study of 1497 hospitalized patients with and without AKI, we found that these 9 vascular biomarkers successfully stratified patients into different risk groups for HF, and were able to improve prediction of HF when added to routine clinical variables. Using the ASSESS-AKI cohort, we performed an unsupervised spectral cluster analysis with 9 plasma biomarkers measured at 3 months post-hospitalization [Angiopoietin (angpt)-1, angpt-2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, VEGF-d, VEGF receptor 1 (R1), solubleTie-2 (sTie-2), placental growth factor (PlGF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)] in 1,497 patients, half of whom had AKI. We used a Cox regression analysis to evaluate the associations between the clusters and HF. Models were adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular disease risk factors, medications, ICU status, lung disease, sepsis, clinical center, and 3-month post-discharge serum creatinine and proteinuria. We calculated change in the area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of HF or death at 3 years by adding the biomarkers to a clinical model selected by a penalized regression with LASSO. We also calculated a net reclassification index for the addition of the biomarkers to the clinical model. Three biomarker-derived clusters were identified: Cluster 1 [n&#x2009;=&#x2009;302, Vascular Injury (Injury) Phenotype] had higher levels of injury markers, whereas Cluster 2 [n&#x2009;=&#x2009;728, Vascular Repair (Repair) Phenotype] had higher levels of repair markers. Cluster 3 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;467) had lower levels of all markers (Dormant Phenotype). Across the entire cohort, those with the Injury Phenotype had twofold higher risk of a HF event compared to the Repair Phenotype [aHR 2.24 (95% CI: 1.57-3.19)] and noted in both participants with AKI [aHR 2.12 (95% CI: 1.35-3.34)] and without AKI [aHR 2.94 (95%CI: 1.57-5.50)]. The Dormant Phenotype was associated with higher risk of HF events only in participants without AKI. The AUC for the prediction of HF event or death at 3 years by the biomarkers was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80) for the clinical model, and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.83) for the combined model. The addition of the biomarkers significantly improved reclassification of HF event or death. Vascular biomarkers can be used to derive phenotypes capable of stratifying future risk of HF events in recently hospitalized patients with or without AKI.",
      "laySummary": "This study investigated whether blood markers could predict heart failure after hospitalization, especially in patients who developed acute kidney injury (AKI). Researchers found that a combination of nine vascular biomarkers could identify different risk groups for heart failure, even when existing risk factors were considered. This suggests that these biomarkers could help doctors better predict and potentially prevent heart failure in patients recovering from illness, particularly those with kidney problems."

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) versus dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) initiation on emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause hospitalizations across the spectrum of kidney disease. This was a retrospective population-based observational cohort study in adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m2 using inverse probability of treatment weighting. The Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) gap time model was used for the primary analysis. The cohort included 24,576 new users of a GLP-1RA and 23,600 DPP4i new users. GLP-1RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of all-cause ED encounters or hospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90; 95% CI 0.87-0.94; P &lt; 0.0001). This finding was consistent in confirmatory analyses using the Andersen-Gill model and the PWP calendar time model. GLP-1RA initiation was associated with a reduction in all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations compared with new use of a DPP4i.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at whether starting treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) was better for people with chronic kidney disease. Researchers found that people who started on GLP-1RAs had a significantly lower risk of needing to visit the emergency room or be hospitalized compared to those who started on DPP-4is. This suggests that GLP-1RAs might be a better medication choice for managing kidney disease and reducing healthcare burdens."

      "abstract": "Previous studies conducted in publicly and privately funded health care systems suggest that access to kidney transplants may vary depending on where a patient receives their kidney care. It is poorly understood whether variability exists across the key steps required to receive a kidney transplant in a publicly funded health care system. To determine whether there is variation across Ontario's regional renal programs (RRPs) in key steps completed toward receiving a kidney transplant. Population-based cohort study from November 1, 2017, to December 31, 2021, using linked administrative health care databases with a maximum follow-up of March 31, 2023. This study includes 27 RRPs and independent health facilities in Ontario, Canada. Patients approaching the need for dialysis and patients receiving maintenance dialysis with no recorded contraindication to kidney transplant. Key steps toward receiving a kidney transplant, including (1) referred to a transplant center for an evaluation; (2) had a potential living donor contact a transplant center to be evaluated; (3) deceased donor waitlist activation; and (4) received a transplant from a living or deceased donor. For each step toward receiving a kidney transplant, we reported a unique incidence rate per 100 person-years with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI), presented by Ontario's RRPs, including the 27 RRPs and independent health facilities. We also presented results by 5 Ontario geographic regions. In an additional analysis, we examined the time to complete specific transplant steps. We included 8319 individuals approaching the need for dialysis and 4869 individuals receiving maintenance dialysis. During follow-up, 2870 (34.5%) individuals approaching the need for dialysis initiated maintenance dialysis. In individuals approaching the need for dialysis, we found the rate of a potential living kidney donor contacting a transplant center to be evaluated varied more than 17-fold across RRPs from 0.67 (95% CI = 0.1, 4.8) to 11.7 (95% CI = 9.2, 14.9). In the dialysis cohort, the average number of steps completed toward receiving a kidney transplant varied almost 4-fold across RRPs from 11.7 (95% CI = 9.3, 14.8) to 44.0 (95% CI = 38.6, 50.1) steps per 100 person-years. The average rate of each step measured separately also varied widely, with the rate of referral to a transplant center for an evaluation (per 100 person-years) varying across RRPs from 6.0 (95% CI = 4.2, 8.5) to 47.9 (95% CI = 42.6, 53.8), the rate of a potential living kidney donor contacting a transplant center to be evaluated from 1.5 (95% CI = 0.78, 2.9) to 10.7 (95% CI = 7.9, 14.5), the rate of deceased donor waitlisting from 2.9 (95% CI = 1.9, 4.4) to 13.2 (95% CI = 11.0, 15.8), and the rate of kidney transplant from 2.0 (95% CI = 1.1, 3.4) to 12.6 (95% CI = 10.8, 14.8). When examining the results by 5 Ontario geographic regions, we found patients receiving maintenance dialysis in Northern Ontario had substantially lower rates of completing key steps toward receiving a kidney transplant. For example, the rate of transplant referral (per 100 person-years) was almost 3-fold lower in Northern Ontario (10.0, 95% CI = 8.3, 12.0) compared to Toronto (28.7, 95% CI = 25.7, 32.1). We did not examine the reason for differences in access to kidney transplant across RRPs (eg, differences in physician practices and staff-to-patient ratio). Despite operating in a publicly funded health care system, there is substantial variability across the 4 key steps required to receive a kidney transplant. Not registered.

Dans une analyse suppl&#xe9;mentaire, nous avons examin&#xe9; le temps requis pour franchir certaines &#xe9;tapes pr&#xe9;cises menant &#xe0; la transplantation. Nous avons inclus 8 319 personnes approchant le besoin de dialyse et 4 869 personnes sous dialyse chronique. Pendant la p&#xe9;riode de suivi, 2 870 (34,5 %) personnes approchant le besoin de dialyse ont amorc&#xe9; des traitements de dialyse chronique. Chez les personnes approchant le besoin de dialyse, nous avons constat&#xe9; que le taux de donneurs de rein vivants potentiels contactant un centre de transplantation pour &#xea;tre &#xe9;valu&#xe9;s variait selon le PRR de 0,67 (IC95: 0,1 &#xe0; 4,8) &#xe0; 11,7 (IC95: 9,2 &#xe0; 14,9), soit de plus de 17 fois. Dans la cohorte des patients sous dialyse, le nombre moyen d&#x2019;&#xe9;tapes franchies variait de presque 4 fois entre les PRR, allant de 11,7 (IC95: 9,3 &#xe0; 14,8) &#xe0; 44,0 (IC95: 38,6 &#xe0; 50,1) &#xe9;tapes pour 100 personnes-ann&#xe9;es. Le taux moyen mesur&#xe9; pour chaque &#xe9;tape s&#xe9;par&#xe9;ment variait aussi consid&#xe9;rablement entre les PRR pour 100 personnes-ann&#xe9;es: le taux d&#x2019;aiguillage vers un centre de transplantation pour une &#xe9;valuation variait de 6,0 (IC95: 4,2 &#xe0; 8,5) &#xe0; 47,9 (IC95: 42,6 &#xe0; 53,8); le taux de donneurs de rein vivants contactant un centre de transplantation pour &#xe9;valuation de 1,5 (IC95: 0,78 &#xe0; 2,9) &#xe0; 10,7 (IC95: 7,9 &#xe0; 14,5); le taux d&#x2019;activation sur la liste d&#x2019;attente pour un organe de donneur d&#xe9;c&#xe9;d&#xe9; de 2,9 (IC95: 1,9 &#xe0; 4,4) &#xe0; 13,2 (IC95: 11,0, 15,8); et le taux de transplantation r&#xe9;nale de 2,0 (IC95: 1,1 &#xe0; 3,4) &#xe0; 12,6 (IC95: 10,8 &#xe0; 14,8). L&#x2019;examen des r&#xe9;sultats selon cinq r&#xe9;gions g&#xe9;ographiques de l&#x2019;Ontario a r&#xe9;v&#xe9;l&#xe9; que les patients sous dialyse chronique du nord de l&#x2019;Ontario avaient des taux consid&#xe9;rablement plus faibles d&#x2019;&#xe9;tapes cl&#xe9;s franchies. Par exemple, le taux d&#x2019;aiguillage pour une greffe (pour 100 personnes-ann&#xe9;es) &#xe9;tait presque trois fois plus faible dans le nord de l&#x2019;Ontario (10,0; IC95: 8,3 &#xe0; 12,0) comparativement &#xe0; Toronto (28,7; IC95: 25,7 &#xe0; 32,1).

      "abstract": "MyTEMP was a cluster-randomized trial to assess the effect of using a personalized cooler dialysate compared to standard temperature dialysate for potential cardiovascular benefits in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis in Ontario, Canada. To conduct Bayesian analyses of the MyTEMP trial, which sought to determine whether adopting a center-wide policy of personalized cooler dialysate is superior to a standard dialysate temperature of 36.5&#xb0;C in reducing the risk of a composite outcome of cardiovascular-related deaths or hospitalizations. Secondary analysis of a parallel-group cluster-randomized trial. In total, 84 dialysis centers in Ontario, Canada, were randomly allocated to the 2 groups. Adult outpatients receiving in-center maintenance hemodialysis from dialysis centers participating in the trial. The primary composite outcome was cardiovascular-related death or hospital admission with myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or congestive heart failure during the 4-year trial period. MyTEMP trial data were analyzed using Bayesian cause-specific parametric Weibull methods to model the survival time with 6 pre-defined reference priors of normal distributions on the log hazard ratio for the treatment effect (strongly enthusiastic, moderately enthusiastic, non-informative, moderately skeptical, skeptical, strongly skeptical). For each analysis, we reported the posterior mean, 2nd, 50th, and 98th percentiles of the treatment effects (hazard ratios) and 96% credible interval (CrI). We also reported the estimated posterior probabilities for different magnitudes of treatment effects. Regardless of priors, Bayesian analysis yielded consistent posterior means and a 96% CrI. The posterior distribution of the hazard ratio was concentrated between 0.95 and 1.05, indicating there was probably no substantial difference between the 2 trial arms. The interpretation of Bayesian methods highly depends on the prior distributions. In our study, the prior distributions were determined by 2 experts without a formal elicitation method. A formal elicitation is encouraged in future trials to better quantify experts' uncertainty about the treatment effect. In addition, we used cause-specific parametric Weibull methods to model survival time, as semi-parametric methods were not available in the standard Bayesian statistical software package at the time of analysis. Our Bayesian analysis indicated that implementing personalized cooler dialysate as a center-wide policy is unlikely to yield meaningful benefits in reducing the composite outcome of cardiovascular-related deaths and hospitalizations, regardless of prior expectations, whether optimistic or skeptical, about the intervention's effectiveness.

Mener des analyses bay&#xe9;siennes de l&#x2019;essai MyTEMP, qui visait &#xe0; d&#xe9;terminer si, dans l&#x2019;ensemble des centres, l&#x2019;adoption d&#x2019;une politique de dialysat personnalis&#xe9; refroidi plut&#xf4;t qu&#x2019;un dialysat &#xe0; temp&#xe9;rature normale (36,5 &#xb0;C) permettait de r&#xe9;duire davantage le risque d&#x2019;un r&#xe9;sultat composite de d&#xe9;c&#xe8;s ou d&#x2019;hospitalisations en lien avec un &#xe9;v&#xe9;nement cardiovasculaire. Analyse secondaire d&#x2019;un essai randomis&#xe9; par grappes en groupes parall&#xe8;les. 84 centres de dialyse de l&#x2019;Ontario (Canada) ont &#xe9;t&#xe9; r&#xe9;partis al&#xe9;atoirement entre les deux groupes.

Sans &#xe9;gard aux a priori, l&#x2019;analyse bay&#xe9;sienne a donn&#xe9; des moyennes post&#xe9;rieures coh&#xe9;rentes et un ICr &#xe0; 96 %. La distribution post&#xe9;rieure du rapport de risque &#xe9;tait concentr&#xe9;e entre 0,95 et 1,05; ce qui indique qu&#x2019;il n&#x2019;y avait probablement pas de diff&#xe9;rence notable entre les deux bras de l&#x2019;essai.

      "abstract": "Multiple studies have shown that older adults' initiation of dialysis is associated with functional decline often within months of starting treatment. This functional impairment has been associated with a 2- to 4-fold higher risk of mortality and morbidity. This study assessed whether rehabilitation within the first few months after starting dialysis may improve physical function and reduce the rates of hospitalization and mortality. Retrospective matched cohort study. Individuals in Ontario, Canada, aged&#x2265;66 years initiating maintenance dialysis whose health care data were recorded by ICES, which captures administrative health data for the population of Ontario. Inpatient rehabilitation care within 6 months of starting dialysis. Change in the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) score during the rehabilitation hospitalization among those receiving rehabilitation. Counts of hospital days, rates of admission to hospitals and long-term care facilities, and mortality over 1 year after the index date for comparisons of those who received rehabilitation to those who did not. Patients receiving rehabilitation and 3 times as many patients not receiving rehabilitation were matched using a propensity score logistic regression model. Outcomes among those who did and did not receive rehabilitation were compared using Cox proportional hazards models and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test for binary outcomes. Among those undergoing rehabilitation, FIM scores improved from 76&#xb1;17 (SD) at admission, to 98&#xb1;19 (SD) by discharge (P&lt;0.001). We matched 1,287 of 1,567 patients (82%) admitted for rehabilitation within 6 months of dialysis with 3,861 patients who did not receive rehabilitation. The patients undergoing rehabilitation had similar 1-year mortality rates to the matched comparison population (27% vs 25%, P=0.5) and had higher hospitalization rates and length-of-stay. Six percent of patients in both groups were admitted to a long-term care facility within the 1-year follow-up (P=0.7). Potential for residual confounding due to the use of administrative data. These data suggest that patients may benefit physically from rehabilitation around the time of starting dialysis. Hospitalization was slightly higher in those undergoing rehabilitation; however, unlike previously published data on those with low baseline functional status, mortality was similar across both groups.",

We used survival analysis to determine the associations between having lower eGFRcys than eGFRcr with risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), major atherosclerotic cardiac events (MACE), heart failure hospitalization, and death after a a median follow-up of 4.7 years. The mean age of study participants was 65.8 years, and 37.3% were female. At 3 months after hospitalization, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) eGFRcr and eGFRcys were 71.5 (51.9-92.6) and 50.5 (34.1-71.9) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, with a median (IQR) absolute difference of -16.3 (-26.1 to -6.3) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and percent difference of -26% (-39% to -11%). The presence of eGFRcys at least 30% lower than eGFRcr at 3 months was associated with a higher risk of heart failure hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.89), ESKD (aHR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.02-3.72), and death (aHR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.64-2.67), and these associations were consistent in participants with and without AKI (<i>P</i> for interaction with AKI all &gt; 0.1). Our findings suggest that the eGFRcys-eGFRcr discrepancy may serve as a valuable prognostic marker in recently hospitalized patients, informing risk stratification and potential interventions.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of kidney failure that is treated with bicarbonate supplementation. The addition of bicarbonate to the dialysis solution and oral bicarbonate supplementation are used to treat metabolic acidosis in patients receiving dialysis, but the treatment approach that is best for patient health remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the concentration of dialysate bicarbonate or the use of oral bicarbonate supplementation alters the risk of mortality, hospitalizations, cardiovascular and nutritional outcomes, and laboratory measurements in patients treated with maintenance dialysis. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Any country of origin. Adult patients (&#x2265;18 years) receiving maintenance dialysis. Extracted data included demographic characteristics and outcomes such as mortality, hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, surrogate markers of nutrition, and pre-dialysis and post-dialysis levels of serum bicarbonate, pH, calcium, potassium, and parathyroid hormone. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Google Scholar through October 7, 2024 for studies examining dialysate bicarbonate concentration and/or oral bicarbonate supplementation in adults undergoing maintenance dialysis. Meta-analysis was performed for pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate and for pre-dialysis and post-dialysis calcium and potassium. We identified 37 studies (n = 24,782 patients) with patients treated with hemodialysis (13 randomized trials, 10 non-randomized interventional studies, 14 observational studies) and 4 studies (n = 347 patients) with patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (3 randomized trials, 1 non-randomized interventional study). No randomized trials reported mortality or hospitalizations in hemodialysis patients. Studies reporting cardiovascular outcomes (n = 20) were small with inconsistent results. Most studies reporting nutritional outcomes (n = 21) reported no significant differences with dialysate bicarbonate concentration or oral bicarbonate supplementation but were small in sample size (largest study n = 200). Meta-analysis of parallel-group randomized trials comparing dialysate bicarbonate &gt;35 mmol/L with &#x2264;35 mmol/L found a mean difference of 3.5 mmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 7.7) in pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate. Non-English and gray literature were excluded. Most studies were small or observational in nature, and heterogeneity further limited the ability to perform meta-analysis of outcomes such as mortality, hospitalizations, and cardiovascular outcomes. The evidence for the effect of higher vs lower dialysate bicarbonate concentration and oral bicarbonate supplementation on clinical outcomes in dialysis patients is very uncertain. There is a need for large, high-quality randomized controlled trials in this area.

      "abstract": "Patients receiving haemodialysis are at very high risk of fragility fracture, yet there are no proven treatments for fracture prevention. We will advance a pilot study on the feasibility of a large, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of denosumab for fragility fracture prevention in haemodialysis. PRevEnting FracturEs in REnal Disease-1 is a pragmatic, open-label, pilot study of an RCT of a denosumab care pathway embedded in routine care haemodialysis centres. We will recruit at least 60 participants at high risk of fracture from at least 6 haemodialysis centres in Ontario, Canada. They must be aged 40 years or older, have access to provincial drug coverage, have appropriate baseline calcium and parathyroid hormone levels and be deemed suitable for denosumab by their kidney care provider. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to denosumab (with supports to mitigate hypocalcaemia) versus usual care using block randomisation by a central statistician (computer-generated sequence). Primary outcomes include recruitment feasibility and adherence. Secondary outcomes include safety (hypocalcaemia) and participant satisfaction with our protocol and processes. Study investigators and data analysts will be blind to treatment allocation.We will present results descriptively. The trial was approved by Clinical Trials Ontario and local research ethics boards across study sites. Primary and secondary outcomes will be published on trial completion. This pilot will inform the feasibility of conducting a large-scale, efficiently run, pragmatic RCT to test whether a denosumab care pathway safely reduces the risk of fragility fracture in patients receiving haemodialysis. Results have the potential to transform fracture care in real-world patients with kidney and metabolic bone disease. NCT05096195.",

      "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known immune related adverse event of cancer immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Further population-based data on AKI incidence, risk factors and practice patterns post-ICI therapy are needed. We measured the cumulative incidence of AKI among advanced cancer patients while receiving ICI therapy and non-ICI systemic therapy in Ontario, Canada (2012-2018). Increase in serum creatinine was used to define AKI and graded according to event severity. Time to event modelling was used to compare the risk of developing AKI, pre-disposing factors and survival outcomes. We studied 16&#x2009;425 patients with advanced cancer receiving either ICI or non-ICI systemic therapy. Among 4&#x2009;380 patients receiving ICI therapy, the overall crude 4-year incidence of AKI (any stage) was 29% and severe AKI (&#x2265; stage 2) was 7%. Characteristics associated with a higher risk of AKI included male sex, genitourinary (versus other) malignancy, the presence of hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and prescription of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The risk of experiencing AKI was significantly lower among patients treated with ICI versus non-ICI systemic therapy [adjusted hazards ratio (aHR)&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI)&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.74-0.86, P-value&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.0001]. Among the 587 patients who experienced an AKI and were both alive and discontinued ICI therapy within 30 days, 54 (9%) were re-challenged with ICI in the following 6 months and 24 (44%) had a recurrent AKI event. Patients who were re-challenged with ICI therapy had improved overall survival as compared to patients that received other non-ICI systemic therapy (aHR&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.38; 95% CI: 0.22-0.67, P-value&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.001). Our real-world study demonstrates a modest risk for AKI among cancer patients receiving ICI therapy, lower than with exposure to other systemic cancer therapies. Among patients who developed AKI and stopped ICI therapy, re-challenge was uncommon but may warrant consideration for select patients.",

Researchers found that AKI is relatively uncommon with immunotherapy compared to other cancer treatments, but certain factors like being male or having pre-existing conditions like diabetes increase the risk. Interestingly, some patients who experienced AKI after stopping immunotherapy were able to safely restart the treatment, and those who did tend to have better outcomes."

This systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42025637001) aim to compare the incidence of anterior vitrectomy in cataract surgeries performed by ophthalmology residents versus experienced surgeons and assess factors contributing to surgical complications.MethodsA systematic search was conducted across EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, PQDT Global, ARVO and AAO for studies published after 2000 that reported on anterior vitrectomy incidence in cataract surgery. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA v. 18.0.ResultsOut of 1,190 screened studies, five studies (four retrospective cohort, one prospective cohort) involving phacoemulsification, extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), and femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) were included, encompassing a total of 4,918 cataract surgeries, and 208 anterior vitrectomy (AV) cases. The random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated a significant AV incidence for residents (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.04, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.06]), while the incidence for experienced surgeons was not statistically significant (ES&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.03, 95% CI: [-0.03, 0.09]). High heterogeneity was observed among the included studies (I&#xb2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;92.1% for residents and I&#xb2;&#x2009;=&#x2009;96.7% for surgeons).ConclusionResidents may have a higher incidence of AV, highlighting the potential benefits of structured surgical training, early exposure, and mentorship in reducing intraoperative complications. Future research should explore simulation-based training and technology-assisted surgery to improve resident proficiency and patient outcomes.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how often a specific complication called anterior vitrectomy occurs during cataract surgery, comparing rates in ophthalmology residents versus experienced surgeons. The research found that residents had a slightly higher chance of needing this complication, suggesting they might benefit from more structured training and mentorship. This highlights the importance of strong surgical training programs to improve patient safety and outcomes."

      "abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern, especially for older adults taking multiple medications. Although Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) use population-based studies to identify adverse drug events, detecting harmful DDIs is challenging due to the millions of potential drug combinations. Traditional pharmacoepidemiologic studies are slow and inefficient, often missing important harmful DDIs. This protocol outlines a novel approach to efficiently identify harmful DDIs using administrative health care data. Using high-throughput computing, we will conduct multiple population-based, new-user cohort studies using Ontario's linked administrative health care data. The cohorts will be selected from the population of Ontario residents aged 66 years and older who filled at least one oral outpatient drug prescription from 2002 to 2023. In each cohort, the exposed group will comprise individuals who are regular users of one drug (drug A) who start a new prescription for a second drug (drug B); the referent group will comprise regular users of drug A not taking drug B. We will evaluate 74 acute outcomes within 30 days of cohort entry, including hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and mortality. Propensity score methods will balance exposed and referent groups on more than 400 baseline health characteristics. Modified Poisson and binomial regression models will estimate risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs). To ensure findings are both statistically and clinically meaningful, we will apply prespecified thresholds for effect sizes (eg, lower bounds of 95% CIs&#x2265;1.33 for RRs and &#x2265;0.1% for RDs) and control the false discovery rate at 5% using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to address multiplicity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including negative control outcomes and E-values, will assess robustness. In a preliminary analysis, we identified approximately 3.8 million older adults who filled prescriptions for over 500 unique medications during the study period (2002-2023), and therefore, approximately 200,000 potential drug combinations will be available for study. The initial drug pair cohorts had a median of 583 new users per cohort (IQR 237-2130); the median overlap in drug pair prescriptions was 57 days (IQR 30-90). The protocol was finalized on August 30, 2025, and outlines the analysis of data from 2002 to 2023. The analysis is scheduled to be completed by fall 2026, with results interpreted in 2027. The final manuscript submission is planned for December 2028. This study aims to identify credible signals of harmful DDIs in older adults in routine care. This study will use an innovative approach that leverages data from provincial administrative health care databases and integrates high-throughput computing and rigorous pharmacoepidemiologic methods to generate robust real-world evidence that can inform safer prescribing practices and regulatory decision-making. DERR1-10.2196/77224.",
      "laySummary": "This research uses a large database of prescription records to quickly identify potentially dangerous combinations of medications in older adults. By analyzing millions of drug pairings, researchers hope to find harmful interactions that might otherwise go unnoticed.  The goal is to improve prescribing practices and make medications safer for seniors by providing evidence-based insights to healthcare providers and regulators."

There were 148&#x2009;994 participants and 9773 kidney failure events during a median of 3.8 years of follow-up. Higher UACR and UPCR both had a log-linear association with increased risk for kidney failure. The association with kidney failure was somewhat stronger for UACR (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per SD increment, 2.55 [95% CI, 2.36 to 2.74]) than UPCR (HR, 2.40 [CI, 2.28 to 2.53]; <i>P</i> for comparison&lt;0.001). Results were consistent to slightly stronger in subgroups with UACR greater than 30 mg/g, UPCR greater than 500 mg/g, eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, diabetes, and glomerular disease. Associations between UACR and UPCR were generally similar for cardiovascular outcomes but favored UACR in subgroups with moderately to severely elevated UACR. Assessment of UACR and UPCR in spot urine samples. Overall, UACR was more strongly associated with kidney failure than UPCR (particularly in subgroups with higher UACR), supporting the use of UACR rather than UPCR to diagnose and risk-stratify patients. National Kidney Foundation and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",
      "laySummary": "This study compared two ways of measuring protein in urine (UACR and UPCR) to see which is better at predicting kidney problems and heart issues. The research found that UACR is slightly better than UPCR at predicting kidney failure, especially in people with higher levels of protein in their urine. This suggests that UACR might be a more useful tool for doctors to assess kidney and cardiovascular risk."

      "abstract": "To assess the validity of the <i>International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision</i> (ICD-10) healthcare database diagnosis codes for lithium toxicity at hospital admission in Ontario, Canada. Population-based retrospective validation study. A total of 152 hospitals linked to a provincial laboratory database in Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2023. Patients 50 years of age or older taking lithium with hospital-based serum lithium laboratory measurements during admission to the hospital (n=2804). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) comparing an ICD-10 diagnostic coding algorithm for lithium toxicity to a serum lithium concentration of 1.5&#x2009;mmol/L or more. The codes used in the algorithm were T568, T435, Y495, X41 and X49. Serum lithium values and changes in the concentration of serum lithium from baseline levels in patients with and without a diagnosis code for lithium toxicity (code-positive and code-negative, respectively). The sensitivity of the ICD-10 coding algorithm for identifying a serum lithium level&#x2265;1.5&#x2009;mmol/L was 84% (95% CI 81% to 87%). The specificity and the NPV were over 88%, and the PPV was 63% (95% CI 60% to 66%). The median (IQR) serum lithium measurement in code-positive patients was 1.7 (1.2 to 2.2)&#x2009;mmol/L, and it was 0.6 (0.4 to 0.9)&#x2009;mmol/L in code-negative patients. The median (IQR) increase in serum lithium concentration compared with the most recent prehospital baseline values was 0.7 (0.2 to 1.3)&#x2009;mmol/L in code-positive patients and 0.0 (-0.2 to 0.2)&#x2009;mmol/L in code-negative patients. In Ontario, the sensitivity of the ICD-10 coding algorithms was moderate for identifying a serum lithium level&#x2265;1.5&#x2009;mmol/L at hospital admission. The presence or absence of the ICD-10 codes for lithium toxicity at hospital admission successfully differentiated two groups of patients with distinct serum lithium measurements.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how well the standard codes hospitals use to record \"lithium toxicity\" actually match patients' lithium levels when they're admitted to the hospital. Researchers found that the codes are reasonably good at identifying patients with high lithium levels, but not perfect, meaning some patients with dangerously high levels might not be captured by the code. This highlights a potential gap in how we track lithium toxicity and could lead to improvements in patient care."

The long-term risk for this outcome attributable to donation is unknown. To evaluate long-term scrotal surgery rates after laparoscopic nephrectomy in male living kidney donors compared with nondonors. Population-based cohort study (2002 to 2024). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06716723). Linked administrative health care databases in Ontario, Canada. 898 male living kidney donors who had a laparoscopic nephrectomy were matched in a 1:10 ratio with 8980 male nondonors from the general population. The matching characteristics were age, date of cohort entry, rural residence, income, prior vasectomy, and prior inguinal hernia repair. Participants were followed for a median of 9 years, up to 22 years. The primary outcome was hospitalization for surgery to address a unilateral scrotal fluid collection. Donors and matched nondonors had a median age of 45 years. The rate of scrotal surgery was higher in donors than nondonors (70 of 898 donors [7.8%] vs. 19 of 8980 nondonors [0.2%]; 8.3 vs. 0.2 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio, 38.8 [95% CI, 22.1 to 67.9]; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).

      "laySummary": "This study found that men who donate a kidney are significantly more likely to need surgery for scrotal swelling on the same side as the removed kidney compared to men who haven't donated.  Over a 20-year period, nearly 14% of kidney donors required surgery for this complication, highlighting a potential long-term risk of living kidney donation for men.

      "abstract": "There are limited real-world data describing the cardiovascular benefits of glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) across the spectrum of chronic kidney disease (CKD) severity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of GLP1RAs with major adverse cardiovascular events in comparison to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors in the setting of CKD. Retrospective observational cohort study. 24,576 new users of GLP1RA and 44,367 new users of DPP-4 inhibitors with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;90ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> in Ontario, Canada. New use of GLP1RAs versus DPP-4 inhibitors. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events, comprising non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, non-fatal ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular death. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the composite outcome, hospitalization or emergency department visits for congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease revascularization, lower limb amputation, and all-cause mortality. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity scores was used to minimize confounding. Multivariable Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard models stratified by eGFR subgroup were fit to evaluate the primary outcome. Mean age of study participants was 69 years, 50% were female, 92% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 40% were taking a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, and 41% had CKD stages 3-5. MACE occurred among 1296 (31.6 per 1000 person-years) GLP1RA users vs. 1374 (36.5 per 1000 person-years) DPP-4 inhibitor users (sHR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97). The lower rate of MACE among GLP1RA users was largely related to a lower rate of cardiovascular death (sHR 0.72, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.85). In subgroup analyses, there was no effect modification between the association of GLP1RA initiation and lower rates of MACE by CKD stages, degree of albuminuria, or concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors. Retrospective design. A substantial amount of missing information on albuminuria. In a population-based study of individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease, GLP1RA initiation was associated with a lower rate of MACE than initiation of DPP-4 inhibitors.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) were safer for the heart than DPP-4 inhibitors in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Researchers found that people with CKD who started taking GLP1RAs had a lower risk of major heart problems like heart attack or stroke compared to those taking DPP-4 inhibitors. This suggests GLP1RAs may be a better choice for heart health in individuals with kidney disease, though more research is needed."

This report describes the characteristics of individuals who received this care since it was established. Provincial administrative health care databases. This is a descriptive study of the characteristics of adults with a registered glomerulonephritis visit provided by a multidisciplinary care team in Ontario, Canada between April 1, 2019, and March 31, 2023. Individuals were excluded if they had evidence of a kidney transplant prior to their first registered visit. A total of 6,926 individuals were included in the cohort. Every year since 2019, approximately 1,200 new individuals had a registered multidisciplinary visit. IgA nephropathy was the most common reported diagnosis at the first registered visit (1,407 of 6,926 [20.5%]). Over a median follow-up period of 2.7 years (interquartile range = 1.3-3.7) since their first registered visit, 420 individuals (6%) received kidney replacement therapy (maintenance dialysis or kidney transplant). This description of individuals with registered visits underestimates the true prevalence of adults with glomerulonephritis in Ontario, as it does not capture those who did not register or who received more advanced disease management in other settings.

However, burosumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against fibroblast growth factor 23, has the same pediatric dose recommendation for both sexes (0.8&#xa0;mg/kg every 2&#xa0;weeks). In a retrospective cohort study, we describe the burosumab response differences by sex in children with XLH. We treated 10 children (5 females, mean age at initiation 4.2&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;3.5&#xa0;years) with XLH with burosumab.

Treatment with ravulizumab was well tolerated. The complement system plays a central role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. We present findings from a phase 2 trial of ravulizumab, a complement C5 inhibitor. The Study of Ravulizumab in Proliferative Lupus Nephritis or IgA Nephropathy (NCT04564339) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of ravulizumab in addition to standard of care.

At week 50, there was a &#x2212;44.8% (95% CI, &#x2212;55.1% to &#x2212;32.1%) change from baseline in urine protein with ravulizumab, and in patients who crossed over from placebo to ravulizumab at week 26, the change from baseline (week 0) to week 50 was &#x2212;45.1% (&#x2212;58.0% to &#x2212;28.4%). The least squares mean change in eGFR from baseline to week 26 with ravulizumab was 0.2 (95% CI, &#x2212;2.3 to 2.7) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and with placebo was &#x2212;4.5 (&#x2212;7.9 to &#x2212;1.1) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. From baseline to week 50, the least squares mean change in eGFR with ravulizumab was &#x2212;3.9 (95% CI, &#x2212;6.4 to&#x2212;1.3) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and in patients who crossed over from placebo to ravulizumab at week 26, it was &#x2212;6.3 (&#x2212;9.7 to &#x2212;2.9) ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Ravulizumab was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that for placebo. An early, sustained, and clinically meaningful reduction in proteinuria and trend toward stabilization of eGFR were observed with ravulizumab versus placebo.

      "abstract": "Low bone density is common among those individuals receiving peritoneal dialysis. While cross-sectional studies support an association between low bone mineral density (BMD) and prevalent fracture, relying on bone density alone, particularly at the lumbar spine and in those with high degrees of hyperparathyroidism may underestimate fracture risk. Commonly used risk calculators in the general population have been shown to perform reasonably well in those receiving dialysis although they do not include any risk factors for high turnover bone disease that may play a role in increased fracture risk. The best options for decreasing fracture risk in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis are unclear. The evidence for bisphosphonates is limited to small studies of BMD, and concerns about drug accumulation have limited their use. Denosumab is more commonly used and has some evidence for improvement in BMD but carries with it a high risk of hypocalcaemia requiring rigorous prophylaxis. More research is needed to explore practical methods to identify those at risk of fracture and determine the efficacy of antiresorptive and anabolic therapies to decrease this risk.",

We created a clinical care pathway focused on the safe provision of denosumab in advanced CKD that reduced the risk of hypocalcemia by 37% at our hospital. Similar pathways could be adopted and tested in other centers. There is an increased risk of hypocalcemia with denosumab in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We aimed to reduce the proportion of patients with advanced CKD who experienced denosumab-induced hypocalcemia at our center. We conducted a quality improvement (QI) project of patients with CKD stage 3b or less (i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;45 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> including dialysis) who were part of the Osteoporosis and Bone Disease Program at St. Joseph's Health Care London (Canada) between December 2020 and January 2023. Our intervention was a clinical care pathway which optimized CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) and 25-hydroxyvitamin levels; provided calcium and vitamin D prophylaxis; promoted multidisciplinary communication between bone and kidney specialists; and carefully monitored calcium post-denosumab injection. Our primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with hypocalcemia (defined by albumin-corrected serum calcium &lt;1.9mmol/L) at 60 days. Process measures included the appropriate provision of calcium and vitamin D prophylaxis. Balance measures included the development of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia following prophylaxis. We used plan-do-see-act cycles to study four tests of change and presented results using descriptive statistics and run charts. There were 6 patients with advanced CKD treated with denosumab prior to the implementation of our care pathway (March 2015-October 2020; 83% receiving dialysis). At the time of their denosumab injection, 83% were using 500-1000 mg of calcium, and 83% used 1000-2000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Fifty percent developed denosumab-induced hypocalcemia. Following the implementation of our care pathway, 15 patients (40% receiving dialysis) were treated with denosumab. Ninety-three percent received calcium at a daily dose of 350 to 2250 mg and 87% received 1000-2000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Thirteen percent developed denosumab-induced hypocalcemia. There was no hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia.

      "abstract": "Kidney transplant recipients are uniquely exposed to the disordered bone metabolism associated with chronic kidney disease beginning before transplantation followed by chronic corticosteroid use after transplantation. Previous efforts to synthesize the rapidly accruing evidence regarding estimation and management of fracture risk in kidney transplant recipients are outdated and incomplete. To synthesize the evidence informing the overall incidence, patient-specific risk prediction, and methods of prevention of fractures in patient living with a kidney transplant. Three systematic reviews will address the following questions: What is the overall incidence of skeletal fracture after kidney transplantation (review 1)? Which prediction models and individual prognostic factors predict fracture in kidney transplant recipients (review 2)? and How effective are different antifracture interventions at preventing fracture or improving surrogate markers of bone health in kidney transplant recipients (review 3)? Cohort studies (reviews 1 and 2) and randomized trials (review 2) with a mean/median follow-up &#x2265;12 months beginning after transplant. Review 3: randomized trials or new-user cohort studies with concurrent controls evaluating the effect of antifracture interventions including bisphosphonates, calcium supplementation, cinacalcet, denosumab, parathyroid hormone analogues, parathyroidectomy, raloxifene, romosozumab, steroid withdrawal or minimization protocols after kidney transplant, vitamin D (both active and nutritional), other antifracture interventions. Adult kidney transplant recipients in studies published after the year 2000. Review 1: incidence rate or cumulative risk of fracture. Review 2: For prediction models, measures of discrimination (eg, c-statistic), calibration (calibration curves, observed:expected ratios), and net benefit (ie, from decision curve analysis); for individual prognostic factors, relative measures of association with fractures. Review 3: measures of treatment effect on fractures and on surrogate markers of bone health (eg, bone mineral density, trabecular bone score). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library using subject headings and keywords related to kidney transplant and fractures. Pairs of reviewers will screen records independently in duplicate to identify studies relevant to one or more of the 3 reviews and categorize each study accordingly. Single reviewers will extract data and evaluate risk of bias for each included study using one of the following tools as appropriate: the Quality of Prognostic Studies tool, the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment tool, the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies-of Interventions tool, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. A second reviewer will independently verify. We will synthesize study-level summary estimates by random-effects meta-analysis for review 1, by vote counting and random-effects meta-analysis in review 2, and by random effects pairwise and, if feasible, network meta-analysis in review 3. We will summarize findings according to latest guidance of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group applicable to each review. Reliance on published studies is susceptible to publication bias, particularly in studies of prediction (review 2) and of treatment effects (review 3). This review will provide an evidence update on 3 topics of relevance to patients, clinicians, guideline developers, and researchers.

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) affects bone and cardiovascular health. We examined the monitoring, control, and outcomes associated with CKD-MBD. Observational cohort study using ICES administrative data. Adults aged 40 years and older from Ontario, Canada, with at least 2 outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate values or receiving dialysis between January 2017 and March 2020. CKD stage based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Albumin-corrected serum calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, and 25 hydroxyvitamin D testing and control at 365 days, and the percentage of patients monitored and controlled per guidelines. We also examined the association between laboratory values, fragility fracture, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in CKD stage 4, 5 and dialysis. Descriptive statistics were used for primary and secondary outcomes. For exploratory outcomes, we examined the cumulative incidence and incidence rate of fragility fracture and MACE based on laboratory values, and adjusted analyses using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. There were 2,580,781 people included, of whom, 303,884 had CKD (stage 3A or higher). Monitoring and control of CKD-MBD was suboptimal across the CKD spectrum. Even in maintenance dialysis, the proportion who met laboratory monitoring targets was low (5.1% had all tests measured over 365 days). The most commonly controlled laboratory value was alkaline phosphatase (55.6% were at target across the CKD spectrum). In exploratory analysis, a small protective effect of a higher calcium and phosphate level on fragility fracture was observed, with a parathyroid hormone level of 20-80 pmol/L appearing optimal for bone health in dialysis. There appeared to be a small statistically significant association between higher levels of alkaline phosphatase and phosphate with MACE in dialysis. Results are only generalizable to adults with laboratory tests reported within the Ontario Laboratory Information System. Exploratory analyses were limited by events. There are gaps in the monitoring and control of CKD-MBD in Ontario, even in groups in which evidence to support management is highest. Focused studies on whether the control of CKD-MBD improves patient-important outcomes remain important. Calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D are important for to kidney health. We examined how often these tests are being measured in people with kidney disease and how well they are being controlled in the real world. We found several gaps in the measurement and control of these laboratory tests - it does appear that having laboratory values in a good range is important for both bone and heart health based on our study. We hope that this study helps doctors and patients, and that it promotes more research in this theme.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at how well doctors are monitoring and managing Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) in Ontario, Canada. Researchers found that monitoring and controlling key blood markers related to bone and heart health was often inadequate, even in patients on dialysis.  However, the study also suggests that keeping calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone levels within a certain range might offer some protection against fractures and heart problems, highlighting the need for better management strategies."

We designed this study to inform perioperative risk interpretation of BNP values. Our primary objective is to validate a formula to convert BNP to NT-pro-BNP concentrations before non-cardiac surgery. The secondary objective is to determine the association between BNP categories (established based on conversion from NT-pro-BNP categories) and a composite outcome of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS) and vascular death. This is a single-centre, prospective cohort study in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery who are &gt;65 years old, Revised Cardiac Risk Index &#x2265;1 or &gt;45 years old with significant cardiovascular disease. BNP and NT-pro-BNP will be measured preoperatively, and troponin measurements will be analysed on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. MINS and vascular death will be ascertained up to 30 days after surgery. The primary analyses will compare measured NT-pro-BNP values to those predicted by an existing formula (from a non-surgical population) based on BNP concentrations and patient characteristics, and recalibrate and update the formula with additional variables. Secondary analyses will estimate the relationship between categories of measured BNP (corresponding to established NT-pro-BNP thresholds) and the composite of MINS and vascular death. The target sample size of 431 patients is based on our primary analysis (assessing the conversion formula). Ethics approval has been obtained by the Queen's University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board, and all participants will provide informed consent for participation in the study. The results will be submitted for publication in conferences and in a peer-reviewed journal, and will inform perioperative vascular risk interpretation of preoperative BNP. NCT05352698.",

      "abstract": "We systematically reviewed the literature to investigate the effects of peri-procedural desmopressin in patients without known inherited bleeding disorders undergoing surgery or other invasive procedures. We included 63 randomized trials (4163 participants) published up to February 1, 2023. Seven trials were published after a 2017 Cochrane systematic review on this topic. There were 38 trials in cardiac surgery, 22 in noncardiac surgery, and 3 in non-surgical procedures. Meta-analyses demonstrated that desmopressin likely does not reduce the risk of receiving a red blood cell transfusion (25 trials, risk ratio [RR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86 to 1.05) and may not reduce the risk of reoperation due to bleeding (22 trials, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.19) when compared to placebo or usual care. However, we demonstrated significant reductions in number of units of red blood cells transfused (25 trials, mean difference -0.55 units, 95% CI&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.94 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.15), total volume of blood loss (33 trials, standardized mean difference&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.40 standard deviations; 95% CI&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.56 to&#x2009;-&#x2009;0.23), and the risk of bleeding events (2 trials, RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.84). The certainty of evidence of these findings was generally low. Desmopressin increased the risk of clinically significant hypotension that required intervention (19 trials, RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.36 to 3.41). Limited evidence suggests that tranexamic acid is more effective than desmopressin in reducing transfusion risk (3 trials, RR 2.38 favoring tranexamic acid, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.39) and total volume of blood loss (3 trials, mean difference 391.7&#xa0;mL favoring tranexamic acid, 95% CI&#x2009;-&#x2009;93.3 to 876.7&#xa0;mL). No trials directly informed the safety and hemostatic efficacy of desmopressin in advanced kidney disease. In conclusion, desmopressin likely reduces periprocedural blood loss and the number of units of blood transfused in small trials with methodologic limitations. However, the risk of hypotension needs to be mitigated. Large trials should evaluate desmopressin alongside tranexamic acid and enroll patients with advanced kidney disease.",

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. We screened studies from a previous comprehensive systematic review, and updated its search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL to July 31, 2023. Patients undergoing non-obstetric surgery. Intravenous tranexamic acid compared to placebo or usual care without tranexamic acid. We summarized the handling of kidney disease in eligibility criteria, dose adjustments for kidney function, and effects of tranexamic acid on thrombotic events, seizures, and bleeding by subgroups of kidney function. We evaluated 300 trials with 53,085 participants; 45,958 participants (86.6%) were enrolled in 228 trials (76.0%) that explicitly excluded patients with kidney disease. Definitions of kidney diseased used for exclusion varied widely. Most were non-specific and some corresponded to mild disease. Only 5 trials adjusted dosing for kidney function. Meta-analysis of two large trials found tranexamic acid unlikely to substantially increase or decrease the occurrence of thrombotic events in patients with eGFR &lt;60&#xa0;mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (RR, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.07) or&#xa0;&#x2265;&#xa0;60&#xa0;mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.11; P for subgroup difference&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.47), but both trials excluded patients with severe kidney disease. No analysis could be performed regarding seizure risk. One large trial in noncardiac surgery reported similar reduction in bleeding across subgroups of kidney function but excluded patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30&#xa0;mL/min. The large evidence base supporting perioperative tranexamic acid suffers from broad and unjustified exclusion of patients with kidney disease. Typical perioperative dosing of tranexamic acid is likely safe and effective in patients with creatinine clearance &gt;30&#xa0;mL/min, but effects in more severe kidney disease are unknown.",

      "abstract": "The Canadian Anatomic Kidney Score (CAKS) is a novel 6-point grading system that standardizes the gross description of a donor kidney across 3 components-vessels, anatomy, and sticky fat. We hypothesized that the CAKS predicts allograft functional outcomes and provides additional information to the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) and histologic assessment of the donor kidney. Single-center cohort of 145 patients who underwent renal transplantation with CAKS analysis between 2018 and 2021. CAKS was prospectively determined before transplantation. Preimplantation core biopsies were assessed according to the Remuzzi score (RS). The primary outcome was 1-y allograft function represented by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Linear regression without adjustment for KDPI or RS showed a significant association between the CAKS and 1-y eGFR (-8.7&#x2009;mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per point increase in CAKS; 95% CI, -13.0 to -4.4; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Most of that association was attributed to the vessel component (-12.1; -19.4 to -4.8; <i>P</i> = 0.002).

Anatomic assessment of donor kidneys at the time of transplantation associates with allograft function at 1 y. Vascular assessment appears to make the dominant contribution.",

      "abstract": "Although major bleeding is among the most common and prognostically important perioperative complications, the relative timing of bleeding events is not well established. This information is critical for preventing bleeding complications and for informing the timing of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. To determine the timing of postoperative bleeding among patients undergoing surgery for up to 30 days after surgery. This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study. Patients aged 45 years or older who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgery were recruited in 14 countries between 2007 and 2013, with follow-up until December 2014. Data analysis was performed from June to July 2023. Noncardiac surgery requiring overnight hospital admission. The primary outcome (postoperative major bleeding) was a composite of the timing of the following bleeding outcomes: (1) bleeding leading to transfusion, (2) bleeding leading to a postoperative hemoglobin level less than 7 g/dL, (3) bleeding leading to death, and (4) bleeding associated with reintervention. Each of the components of the composite primary outcome (1-4) and bleeding independently associated with mortality after noncardiac surgery, which was defined as a composite of outcomes 1 to 3, were secondary outcomes. Among 39&#x202f;813 patients (median [IQR] age, 63.0 [54.8-72.5] years; 19&#x202f;793 women [49.7%]), there were 5340 major bleeding events (primary outcome) in 4638 patients (11.6%) within the first 30 days after surgery. Of these events, 42.7% (95% CI, 40.9%-44.6%) occurred within 24 hours after surgery, 77.7% (95% CI, 75.8%-79.5%) by postoperative day 7, 88.3% (95% CI, 86.5%-90.2%) by postoperative day 14, and 94.6% (95% CI, 92.7%-96.5%) by postoperative day 21. Within 48 hours of surgery, 56.2% of major bleeding events, 56.2% of bleeding leading to transfusion, 56.1% of bleeding independently associated with mortality after noncardiac surgery, 51.8% of bleeding associated with hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL, and 51.8% of bleeding associated with reintervention had occurred. In this cohort study, of the major postoperative bleeding events in the first 30 days, more than three-quarters occurred during the first postoperative week. These findings are useful for researchers for the planning future clinical research and for clinicians in prevention of bleeding-related surgical complications and in decision-making regarding starting of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis after surgery.",

      "abstract": "Surgical patients are often transfused to manage bleeding and anemia. Best practices for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion administration in patient having noncardiac surgery remains controversial and a robust evaluation and description of perioperative transfusion practices is lacking. We characterized perioperative hemoglobin concentrations and transfusion practices from the prospective VISION cohort which included 39,222 patients aged &#x2265;45 years who had inpatient noncardiac surgery. Variations in transfusion practices were analyzed using hierarchical mixed models, and associations with mortality and complications were evaluated using a nested frailty survival model. Within the cohort, 16.1% (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;6296) were given perioperative RBC transfusions, with the fraction declining from 20% to 13% over the 6-year study period. The proportion of patients transfused varied by surgery type from 6.4% for low-risk operations (i.e., minor surgery) to 31.5% for orthopedic surgeries. Variations were largely associated with patient hemoglobin concentrations, but also with center (range: 3.7%-27.3%) and country (0.4%-25.3%). Even after adjusting for baseline hemoglobin, comorbidities and type of surgery, both center and country were significant sources of variation in transfusion practices. Among transfused participants, 60.4% (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;3728/6170) had at least 1 hemoglobin concentration &#x2264;80g/L and 86.0% (n&#x202f;=&#x202f;5305/6170) had at least 1 hemoglobin concentration &#x2264;90g/L, suggesting that relatively restrictive transfusion strategies were used in most. The proportion of patients receiving at least 1 RBC transfusion declined from 20% to 13% over 6 years. However, there was considerable unexplained variation in transfusion practices.",

Risk factors including positive family history and extra-kidney features associate with higher diagnostic yield, although young age at testing did not. Seventeen percent of patients who received a genetic diagnosis were reclassified into a different phenotype after testing. Clinical and pathological confirmation of the diagnosis for CKD has limitations, with up to one third of individuals remaining without a formal diagnosis. Increasingly, data suggest that these limitations can be overcome by genetic testing. The objective of this study was to estimate the diagnostic yield of genetic testing in adults with CKD. Cohort studies that report diagnostic yield of genetic testing in adults with CKD published in PubMed or Embase between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2023, were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for prevalence studies was used to assess bias. Duplicate independent data extraction and a meta-analysis of proportions using generalized linear mixed models were completed. We included 60 studies with 10,107 adults with CKD who underwent genetic testing. We found a diagnostic yield of 40% (95% confidence interval, 33 to 46); yield varied by CKD subtype with the highest yield of 62% (95% confidence interval, 57 to 68) in cystic kidney disease. Positive family history and presence of extra-kidney features were associated with higher diagnostic yield. Reclassification of the before testing diagnosis after a positive genetic testing result occurred in 17% of the solved cohort. Six studies showed the clinical benefits of genetic testing including cascade testing for family members and treatment changes. Overall, we show that genetic testing is informative in a high proportion of clinically selected adults with CKD.

      "abstract": "People with advanced kidney disease undergo more noncardiac operations compared with the general population, with a higher risk of perioperative cardiac events and death. However, little is known about the associations between severity of preoperative kidney dysfunction with postoperative length of hospitalization and discharge disposition; these were the focus of this study. Population-based retrospective cohort. Adults from Alberta, Canada, undergoing inpatient major noncardiac surgery between April 2005 and February&#xa0;2019. Categorical preoperative outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or kidney failure status. Length of stay (LOS), days alive at home after surgery within 30 and 90 days, and discharge disposition location. Associations were estimated with unadjusted and adjusted generalized estimating equation models. We identified 927,560 inpatient surgeries in 666,770 people (55.9% female; median age, 57.4 years). People receiving dialysis had the longest LOS (11 days [95% CI, 6-29]), 2 times greater than that among people with normal kidney function (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.21 [95% CI, 2.10-2.32]). This group also had the fewest days alive at home within the first 30 days after surgery, with an IRR of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.67-0.70) compared with people with normal eGFR. The majority of people (82.8%) were discharged home without nursing support after surgery, though people receiving dialysis were discharged to a facility with 24-hour nursing care nearly 4 times more often. There were graded increases in risks of these outcomes with lower levels of kidney function. Many people did not have preoperative kidney function assessed, reflecting standard clinical practice in the general population. After major surgery, people with kidney disease spend more time recovering in hospital and have less independence from postdischarge nursing supports than otherwise similar patients who have normal or near normal kidney function. These differences were more pronounced for those with the most severe stages of kidney disease. People with kidney disease have surgery more frequently, with worse outcomes, compared with others in the general population. However, little is known about how long they spend in hospital afterward and whether they will be discharged home or to other facilities. To understand this more, we examined nearly 1 million surgeries performed in Alberta, Canada. Compared with people who have normal kidney function and are undergoing surgery, people with the most advanced kidney disease spent more than 2 times longer in hospital and were more likely to be discharged to long-term care facilities instead of being discharged to their homes. Future research is needed to understand the factors that predict who will experience prolonged hospitalization and to develop interventions to enable earlier discharge for people with kidney disease.",

      "abstract": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a major postoperative risk. Systematic reviews have established procedure-specific VTE risk estimates, which form 1 component of the CLUE postsurgery VTE risk instrument. The instrument also incorporates patient-level factors, including age (&#x2265;75 years), body mass index (&#x2265;35 kg/m2), and prior VTE, to stratify overall risk. However, the patient risk factor component has not been formally validated. Therefore, we conducted the validation using data from the VISION study, a prospective, international cohort of 11&#x2009;636 patients undergoing major general abdominal, urologic, or gynecologic surgery. Thirty-day postoperative VTE incidence was analyzed using modified Poisson regression. The instrument classified patients into low- (72%), medium- (25%), and high-risk (4%) categories. VTE occurred in 97 patients (0.8%). Compared to the low-risk group, the relative risk of VTE was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.43) for medium-risk patients and 3.60 (95% CI, 1.90-6.83) for high-risk patients. Among patients who did not receive antithrombotic medication, relative risks increased to 1.91 for medium-risk patients and 5.41 for high-risk patients. The CLUE postsurgery VTE risk instrument, using 3 widely available patient-level factors, accurately classifies patients into substantially different categories of relative VTE risk. This validated patient component complements procedure-specific absolute risk estimates derived from prior systematic reviews. To support evidence-based thromboprophylaxis decisions, the instrument is now available through an interactive online platform (www.cluevte.org).",
      "laySummary": "This study validated a tool called CLUE that helps estimate a patient's risk of blood clots after abdominal or pelvic surgery. Researchers found that by considering factors like age, weight, and prior blood clots, the CLUE tool accurately categorizes patients into low, medium, or high risk for post-surgery blood clots. This improved risk assessment can help doctors decide who needs preventative medication to reduce the chance of dangerous blood clots."

In the hypotension-avoidance strategy, the intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) target was 80 mm Hg or greater; before and for 2 days after surgery, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors were withheld, and other chronic antihypertensive medications were administered for systolic blood pressures of 130 mm Hg or greater following an algorithm.

      "abstract": "Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension are associated with myocardial injury/infarction, stroke, acute kidney injury, and death. Because of its prolonged duration, postoperative hypotension contributes more to the risk of organ injury compared with intraoperative hypotension. A prediction model for clinically important postoperative hypotension after noncardiac surgery is needed to guide clinicians. We performed a secondary analysis of the Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation (VISION) study. Patients aged &#x2265;45 yr who had inpatient noncardiac surgery across 28 centres in 14 countries were included. In 14 of the centres selected at random (derivation cohort), we evaluated 49 variables using logistic regression to develop a model to predict postoperative clinically important hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure &#x2264;90 mm Hg, that resulted in clinical intervention. The postoperative period was defined from the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit to hospital discharge. We then evaluated its calibration and discrimination in the other 14 centres (validation cohort). Among 40 004 patients in VISION, 20 442 (51.1%) were included in the derivation cohort, and 19 562 (48.9%) patients were included in the validation cohort. The incidence of clinically important postoperative hypotension in the entire cohort was 12.4% (4959 patients). A 41-variable model predicted the risk of clinically important postoperative hypotension (bias-corrected C-statistic: 0.73, C-statistic in validation cohort: 0.72). A simplified prediction model also predicted clinically important hypotension (bias-corrected C-statistic: 0.68) based on four information items. Postoperative clinically important hypotension may be estimated before surgery using our primary model and a simple four-element model. NCT00512109.",
      "laySummary": "Researchers developed a tool to predict which patients are likely to experience significant low blood pressure after non-heart surgery. Using data from a large international study, they created a prediction model that can identify patients at higher risk, allowing doctors to take preventative measures. This tool could help reduce serious complications like organ damage and even death associated with postoperative hypotension."

Among patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis, preoperative decreases in Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> were significantly associated with postoperative mortality. The connection between preoperative hemodialysis practices and postoperative outcomes warrants further investigation. Little is known about preoperative hemodialysis dosing for patients with ESKD. We assessed whether changes in preoperative hemodialysis dose (compared with and controlling for baseline dose) are associated with postoperative mortality in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis. We identified fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries receiving hemodialysis for ESKD who underwent surgical procedures between January 1, 2011, and November 30, 2020. Follow-up ended December 31, 2020. The primary exposure was preoperative change in Kt/V<sub>urea</sub>, defined as the difference between the Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> in the hemodialysis session proximal to the procedure and the mean Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> for the preceding 180 days. The primary outcome was postoperative 30-day mortality. The relation between preoperative change in Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> and the primary outcome was modeled using a Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusted for mean and SD of Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> in the 180 days preceding the procedure, and for other covariates. Among 151,240 procedures (median age, 65 years [25%&#x2013;75% range, 56&#x2013;73], 63,437 [41.9%] in women), 31,825 (21.0%) had a preoperative change in Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> of &lt;&#x2212;0.10, 43,790 (29.0%) had a preoperative change of &#x2212;0.10 to &lt;0, 45,058 (29.8%) had a preoperative change of 0 to &lt;+0.10, and 30,567 (20.2%) had a preoperative change of &#x2265;+0.10. The median Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> for the 180 days before the procedure was 1.58 (25th&#x2013;75th percentiles, 1.45&#x2013;1.74). In adjusted analysis, compared with patients with a preoperative change in Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> of 0 to &lt;+0.10, 30-day mortality was 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 1.70) times higher with a preoperative Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> change of &#x2264;&#x2212;0.10 and 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.31) times higher with a preoperative Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> change of &#x2212;0.10 to &lt;0. Increases in preoperative Kt/V<sub>urea</sub> that were &gt;0.10 were not significantly associated with 30-day mortality.

      "abstract": "Patients undergoing maintenance dialysis for kidney failure are at substantial risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to establish if spironolactone reduces heart failure and cardiovascular deaths in these patients. ACHIEVE was an international, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial done in 143 dialysis programmes in 12 countries. Patients were aged 45 years or older, or aged 18 years or older with a history of diabetes, and were receiving maintenance dialysis for kidney failure for at least 3 months at the time of recruitment. Patients who were able to tolerate and adhere to spironolactone 25 mg daily orally during an open-label run-in were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue spironolactone or matching placebo, using a central computerised block randomisation system (block sizes of 4) stratified by centre. Participants, health-care providers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure analysed as time-to-event in all randomly assigned participants. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03020303. After a planned interim analysis of 75% of the expected primary outcome events, the external safety and efficacy monitoring committee recommended the trial be stopped early for futility. From Sept 19, 2017, to Oct 31, 2024, 3689 patients were screened for inclusion, 3565 of whom were enrolled in the open-label run-in phase, and 2538 were randomly assigned to spironolactone (n=1260) or placebo (n=1278). 931 (36&#xb7;7%) participants were female and 1607 (63&#xb7;3%) were male. Median follow-up was 1&#xb7;8 years (IQR 0&#xb7;85-3&#xb7;35). The composite primary outcome occurred in 258 participants (10&#xb7;46 events per 100 patient-years) in the spironolactone group and in 276 participants (11&#xb7;33 per 100 patient-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0&#xb7;92 [95% CI 0&#xb7;78-1&#xb7;09]; p=0&#xb7;35). Death from any cause was similar between groups (HR 0&#xb7;95 [0&#xb7;83-1&#xb7;09]) as was hospitalisation for any cause (HR 0&#xb7;96 [0&#xb7;87-1&#xb7;06]). Among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, spironolactone 25 mg daily orally did not reduce the composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to heart failure compared with placebo. This trial did not identify a benefit of initiating spironolactone in patients receiving maintenance dialysis.

Adult participants (aged 18-60 years) with biopsy-confirmed C3 glomerulopathy were enrolled from 35 hospitals or medical centres in 18 countries. Inclusion criteria included reduced serum C3 concentration (ie, &lt;77 mg/dL [defined as &lt;0&#xb7;85&#x2009;&#xd7;&#x2009;lower limit of the central laboratory normal range]) at screening, urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 1&#xb7;0 g/g or higher at day -75 and day -15 before randomisation, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min per 1&#xb7;73 m<sup>2</sup> or higher at screening and day -15, and vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. All eligible participants were randomised 1:1 via interactive response technology to either the iptacopan or the placebo group, stratified by treatment with corticosteroids, mycophenolic acid, or both (yes or no). During the 6-month double-blind period, participants orally received either iptacopan 200 mg twice daily or placebo; this was followed by a 6-month open-label period in which all participants received iptacopan 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in proteinuria (measured by log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR sampled from a 24-h urine collection) at 6 months. The primary analyses were done in the full analysis set (ie, all participants to whom study treatment was assigned by randomisation); all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment were included in the safety analysis. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04817618) and the adult cohort has been completed. Between July 28, 2021, and Feb 15, 2023, 132 participants were screened, of whom 58 did not complete the screening period and 74 (64% male; 69% White) were randomised 1:1 to receive either iptacopan (n=38) or placebo (n=36). One participant in the placebo group discontinued treatment during the open-label period. The 24-h UPCR percentage change relative to baseline at 6 months was -30&#xb7;2% (95% CI -42&#xb7;8 to -14&#xb7;8) in the iptacopan group and 7&#xb7;6% (-11&#xb7;9 to 31&#xb7;3) in the placebo group. In the iptacopan group, the geometric mean of 24-h UPCR was 3&#xb7;33 g/g (95% CI 2&#xb7;79 to 3&#xb7;97) at baseline and 2&#xb7;17 g/g (1&#xb7;62 to 2&#xb7;91) at 6 months; in the placebo group, this was 2&#xb7;58 g/g (2&#xb7;18 to 3&#xb7;05) at baseline and 2&#xb7;80 g/g (2&#xb7;37 to 3&#xb7;30) at 6 months. The primary endpoint was met with a relative reduction in 24-h UPCR at 6 months for iptacopan versus placebo of 35&#xb7;1% (13&#xb7;8 to 51&#xb7;1; p=0&#xb7;0014). 30 (79%) of 38 participants in the iptacopan group had treatment-emergent adverse events, compared with 24 (67%) of 36 participants in the placebo group; most of these were of mild or moderate severity. There were no deaths, no treatment discontinuations due to treatment-emergent adverse events, and no meningococcal infections. Serious adverse events were reported in three (8%) participants in the iptacopan group and one (3%) participant in the placebo group. Iptacopan showed a statistically significant, clinically meaningful proteinuria reduction in addition to RAAS inhibitors and immunosuppression at 6 months. Iptacopan was well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in patients with C3 glomerulopathy. Novartis Pharma.",
      "laySummary": "This study investigated a new oral medication called iptacopan for people with a rare and serious kidney disease called C3 glomerulopathy.  The research found that iptacopan significantly reduced protein in the urine in patients with this condition compared to a placebo, and it was generally well-tolerated. This suggests iptacopan could be a valuable new treatment option for C3 glomerulopathy, offering a way to slow disease progression."

      "abstract": "Better informative predictive tools are required to improve risk-stratification in patients undergoing surgery. Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has the potential to predict postoperative complications. The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the association between suPAR measured around the time of surgery and perioperative complications. We systematically reviewed studies indexed in Embase or PubMed from inception up to October 8, 2024. We included studies evaluating the association between suPAR measured around surgery and perioperative complications captured up to 90 days after surgery. We excluded case reports, reviews, editorials, studies with non-human participants, and clinical practice guidelines. We used the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool to assess the risk of bias, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation to ascertain the certainty in the inference for reported associations. Eighteen of the 19 included studies provided evaluable data from 6410 patients on the association between suPAR and perioperative outcomes. There was moderate certainty that suPAR associates with acute kidney injury, low certainty of association with mortality, very low certainty of association with composites of multiple complications, resource utilization outcomes, and infectious complications. However, we were highly uncertain about the magnitude of association because studies were heterogeneous, poorly reported, mostly retrospective, and too small to provide robust estimates. We conclude that serum or plasma concentrations of suPAR measured around surgery is likely associated with perioperative complications, especially acute kidney injury. The magnitude of these associations and the clinical value of suPAR should now be compared to other clinical information and prognostic biomarkers in biobanks of large prospective studies.",
      "laySummary": "This research looked at whether a protein called suPAR in the blood could predict problems after surgery. The review found that suPAR levels are likely linked to an increased risk of acute kidney injury following surgery, but the link to other complications and overall outcomes is less clear.  Measuring suPAR around the time of surgery might eventually help doctors identify patients at higher risk for complications, but more research is needed to understand how best to use this information."

      "abstract": "About 40 disease genes have been described to date for isolated CAKUT, the most common cause of childhood CKD. However, these genes account for only 20% of cases. ARHGEF6, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is implicated in biologic processes such as cell migration and focal adhesion, acts downstream of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and parvin proteins. A genetic variant of ILK that causes murine renal agenesis abrogates the interaction of ILK with a murine focal adhesion protein encoded by Parva , leading to CAKUT in mice with this variant. To identify novel genes that, when mutated, result in CAKUT, we performed exome sequencing in an international cohort of 1265 families with CAKUT. We also assessed the effects in vitro of wild-type and mutant ARHGEF6 proteins, and the effects of Arhgef6 deficiency in mouse and frog models. We detected six different hemizygous variants in the gene ARHGEF6 (which is located on the X chromosome in humans) in eight individuals from six families with CAKUT. In kidney cells, overexpression of wild-type ARHGEF6 -but not proband-derived mutant ARHGEF6 -increased active levels of CDC42/RAC1, induced lamellipodia formation, and stimulated PARVA-dependent cell spreading. ARHGEF6-mutant proteins showed loss of interaction with PARVA. Three-dimensional Madin-Darby canine kidney cell cultures expressing ARHGEF6-mutant proteins exhibited reduced lumen formation and polarity defects. Arhgef6 deficiency in mouse and frog models recapitulated features of human CAKUT. Deleterious variants in ARHGEF6 may cause dysregulation of integrin-parvin-RAC1/CDC42 signaling, thereby leading to X-linked CAKUT.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic bladder is caused by disruption of neuronal pathways regulating bladder relaxation and contraction. In severe cases, neurogenic bladder can lead to vesicoureteral reflux, hydroureter, and chronic kidney disease. These complications overlap with manifestations of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). To identify novel monogenic causes of neurogenic bladder, we applied exome sequencing (ES) to our cohort of families with CAKUT. By ES, we have identified a homozygous missense variant (p.Gln184Arg) in CHRM5 (cholinergic receptor, muscarinic, 5) in a patient with neurogenic bladder and secondary complications of CAKUT. CHRM5 codes for a seven transmembrane-spanning G-protein-coupled muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. CHRM5 is shown to be expressed in murine and human bladder walls and is reported to cause bladder overactivity in Chrm5 knockout mice. We investigated CHRM5 as a potential novel candidate gene for neurogenic bladder with secondary complications of CAKUT. CHRM5 is similar to the cholinergic bladder neuron receptor CHRNA3, which Mann et al. published as the first monogenic cause of neurogenic bladder. However, functional in vitro studies did not reveal evidence to strengthen the status as a candidate gene. Discovering additional families with CHRM5 variants could help to further assess the genes' candidate status.",

      "abstract": "Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment. Complement and coagulation gene variants have been associated with aHUS susceptibility. We assessed the diagnostic yield of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel in a large cohort of Canadian patients with suspected aHUS. Molecular testing was performed on peripheral blood DNA samples from 167 patients, collected between May 2019 and December 2021, using a clinically validated NGS pipeline. Coding exons with 20 base pairs of flanking intronic regions for 21 aHUS-associated or candidate genes were enriched using a custom hybridization protocol. All sequence and copy number variants were assessed and classified following American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Molecular diagnostic results were reported for four variants in three individuals (1.8%). Twenty-seven variants of unknown significance were identified in 25 (15%) patients, and 34 unique variants in candidate genes were identified in 28 individuals. An illustrative patient case describing two genetic alterations in complement genes is presented, highlighting that variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance must be considered when interpreting genetic data in patients with complement-mediated disease, alongside the potential additive effects of genetic variants on aHUS pathophysiology. In this cohort of patients with suspected aHUS, using clinical pipelines for genetic testing and variant classification, pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants occurred in a very small percentage of patients. Our results highlight the ongoing challenges in variant classification following NGS panel testing in patients with suspected aHUS, alongside the need for clear testing guidance in the clinical setting. KEY MESSAGES: &#x2022; Clinical molecular testing for disease associated genes in aHUS is challenging. &#x2022; Challenges include patient selection criteria, test validation, and interpretation. &#x2022; Most variants were of uncertain significance (31.7% of patients; VUS + candidates). &#x2022; Their clinical significance may be elucidated as more evidence becomes available.&#xa0; &#x2022; Low molecular diagnostic rate (1.8%), perhaps due to strict classification criteria. &#x2022; Case study identified two likely pathogenic variants; one each in&#xa0;MCP/CD46&#xa0;and&#xa0;CFI.",

Over 40 genes have been identified as causative for isolated human CAKUT. However, many genes remain unknown, and the prioritization of potential CAKUT candidate genes is challenging. To develop an independent approach to prioritize CAKUT candidate genes, we hypothesized that monogenic CAKUT genes are most likely co-expressed along a temporal axis during kidney development and that genes with coinciding high expression may represent strong novel CAKUT candidate genes. We analyzed single-cell mRNA (sc-mRNA) transcriptomics data of human fetal kidney for temporal sc-mRNA co-expression of 40 known CAKUT genes. A maximum of high expression in consecutive timepoints of kidney development was found for four of the 40 genes (EYA1, SIX1, SIX2, and ITGA8) in nephron progenitor cells a, b, c, d (NPCa-d). We concluded that NPCa-d are relevant for CAKUT pathogenesis and intersected two lists of CAKUT candidate genes resulting from unbiased whole-exome sequencing (WES) with the 100 highest expressed genes in NPCa-d. Intersection of the 100 highest expressed genes in NPCa-d with WES-derived CAKUT candidate genes identified an overlap with the candidate genes KIF19, TRIM36, USP35, CHTF18, in each of which a biallelic variant was detected in different families with CAKUT. Sc-mRNA expression data of human fetal kidney can be utilized to prioritize WES-derived CAKUT candidate genes. KIF19, TRIM36, USP35, and CHTF18 may represent strong novel candidate genes for CAKUT.",

      "abstract": "Alport Syndrome (AS) is a progressive genetic condition characterized by chronic kidney disease (CKD), hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. It is caused by mutations in the genes <i>COL4A3, COL4A4</i>, and <i>COL4A5</i>. Heterozygous mutations in <i>COL4A4</i> and <i>COL4A3</i> cause autosomal dominant Alport Syndrome (ADAS), and a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic hematuria to CKD, with variable extra-renal features. In the past, heterozygous mutations in these genes were thought to be benign, however recent studies show that about 30% of patients can progress to CKD, and 15% can progress to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). We present a case of a woman who was noted to have microscopic hematuria pre-living kidney donation. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in the <i>COL4A4</i> gene. VUSs are medically nonactionable findings and data show that VUSs can be detected in 41% of all patients who undergo clinical genetic testing. VUSs frustrate clinicians and patients alike. Although they cannot be used in medical decision-making, data suggest that reanalysis can result in the reclassification of a VUS over time. Post-donation, the index patient had a higher than anticipated rise in serum creatinine, raising a concern for possible intrinsic kidney disease. Kidney biopsy was deemed high risk in the setting of a unilateral kidney thereby limiting possible diagnostic intervention to determine the cause of disease. Re-evaluation of prior genetic testing results and reassessment of the previously identified VUS in <i>COL4A4</i> was performed 5-years post-donation. These analyses, along with the addition of new phenotypic data and extended pedigree data, resulted in the reclassification of the previously identified VUS to a likely pathogenic variant. This case demonstrates the importance of structured, periodic re-evaluation of genetic testing results. With the ever-changing landscape of genetics in medicine, the interpretation of a VUS can be dynamic and therefore warrant caution in living kidney donor evaluations. Studies have shown that about 10% of VUSs can be upgraded to a pathogenic classification after an 18- to 36-month interval. Structured re-evaluation of genomic testing results has not yet been integrated into clinical practice and poses a unique challenge in living kidney donation. This case report highlights the variability of the ADAS phenotype caused by pathogenic heterozygous variants in the type 4 collagen genes. It supports the nomenclature change from a benign hematuria phenotype to ADAS, particularly when additional risk factors such as proteinuria, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or glomerular basement membrane changes on kidney biopsy are present, or as in this case, evidence of disease in other family members.

Les variants de signification incertaine (VSI) sont des r&#xe9;sultats qui ne peuvent &#xea;tre utilis&#xe9;s m&#xe9;dicalement et les donn&#xe9;es montrent qu&#x2019;ils peuvent &#xea;tre d&#xe9;tect&#xe9;s chez 41 % des patients qui subissent des tests g&#xe9;n&#xe9;tiques cliniques. Les VSI sont frustrants tant pour les cliniciens que pour les patients. Bien qu&#x2019;ils ne puissent pas &#xea;tre utilis&#xe9;s dans la prise de d&#xe9;cisions m&#xe9;dicales, les donn&#xe9;es sugg&#xe8;rent que leur r&#xe9;analyse pourrait entra&#xee;ner leur reclassification au fil du temps. Apr&#xe8;s le don, ce cas index a pr&#xe9;sent&#xe9; une &#xe9;l&#xe9;vation de la cr&#xe9;atinine s&#xe9;rique plus importante que pr&#xe9;vu, ce qui a soulev&#xe9; une pr&#xe9;occupation quant &#xe0; la pr&#xe9;sence d&#x2019;une n&#xe9;phropathie intrins&#xe8;que. La biopsie r&#xe9;nale a &#xe9;t&#xe9; jug&#xe9;e &#xe0; haut risque dans le contexte de rein unilat&#xe9;ral, ce qui a limit&#xe9; la possible intervention diagnostique pour d&#xe9;terminer la cause de la maladie. La r&#xe9;&#xe9;valuation des r&#xe9;sultats des tests g&#xe9;n&#xe9;tiques ant&#xe9;rieurs et du VSI pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;demment identifi&#xe9; dans <i>COL4A4</i> a &#xe9;t&#xe9; r&#xe9;alis&#xe9;e 5 ans apr&#xe8;s le don. Ces analyses, ainsi que l&#x2019;ajout de nouvelles donn&#xe9;es ph&#xe9;notypiques et de donn&#xe9;es g&#xe9;n&#xe9;alogiques &#xe9;tendues, ont abouti &#xe0; la reclassification du VSI pr&#xe9;c&#xe9;demment identifi&#xe9; en variant probablement pathog&#xe8;ne. Ce cas illustre l&#x2019;importance de r&#xe9;&#xe9;valuer de fa&#xe7;on structur&#xe9;e et p&#xe9;riodique les r&#xe9;sultats des tests g&#xe9;n&#xe9;tiques. La g&#xe9;n&#xe9;tique &#xe9;tant en constante &#xe9;volution en m&#xe9;decine, l&#x2019;interpr&#xe9;tation d&#x2019;un VSI peut &#xea;tre dynamique et, ainsi, justifier la prudence dans les &#xe9;valuations des donneurs de reins vivants. Des &#xe9;tudes ont montr&#xe9; qu&#x2019;environ 10 % des VSI peuvent &#xea;tre reclass&#xe9;s comme pathog&#xe8;nes apr&#xe8;s 18 &#xe0; 36 mois. La r&#xe9;&#xe9;valuation structur&#xe9;e des r&#xe9;sultats des tests g&#xe9;nomiques, qui n&#x2019;a pas encore &#xe9;t&#xe9; int&#xe9;gr&#xe9;e dans la pratique clinique, pose un d&#xe9;fi unique dans le contexte d&#x2019;un don vivant de reins. Ce rapport de cas met en &#xe9;vidence la variabilit&#xe9; du ph&#xe9;notype du SAAD caus&#xe9; par des variants h&#xe9;t&#xe9;rozygotes pathog&#xe8;nes dans les g&#xe8;nes du collag&#xe8;ne de type 4.

      "abstract": "Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) encompass heterogenous malformations arising from defective nephrogenesis. To date, approximately 50 monogenic genes are known to cause CAKUT if mutated. Recent studies show the impact of de novo variants in genetic disease etiology. Trio exome sequencing identifies de novo variants in novel candidate genes in 19.62% of CAKUT families. We performed trio-based exome sequencing in 209 families with CAKUT to detect novel candidate disease genes. Trio analysis yielded in the identification of CAKUT candidate genes in 96 of 209 trio families (45.93%). In 41 of 209 cases, we detected strong de novo variants in 45 potential novel CAKUT candidate genes (19.62%). We developed a prioritization approach that highlights a truncating de novo variant in SOX13 (HGNC:11192) as a promising cause for CAKUT. In addition, further allele carriers for the candidate gene CHD1L (HGNC:1916) were identified, thus supporting the role of CHD1L in the pathogenesis of CAKUT. We conclude that de novo variants in potential novel CAKUT candidate genes contribute to the disease etiology and present SOX13 as a potential novel cause for CAKUT.",

Despite strong evidence supporting its clinical utility and cost effectiveness, significant barriers hinder its widespread adoption. This review examines care models designed to embed genetic testing into nephrology practice and proposes strategies to improve access for chronic kidney disease patients. Key approaches include enhancing clinical genetic services, establishing kidney genetics clinics, using technology such as virtual consultations, forming variant review boards and multidisciplinary teams, and mainstreaming genetic testing into nephrology care. For each model, the review identifies essential components for success and discusses barriers and facilitators to implementation. By focusing on practical, scalable, and patient-centered solutions, this review advocates for a paradigm shift in nephrology care. It envisions genetic testing as a standard component of kidney disease management, aiming to improve outcomes and promote equitable care for patients globally.",

      "abstract": "Genetic causes account for 10% to 20% of adult and 30% to 50% of pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with genetic CKD have a higher risk of progression to kidney failure. More than 500 genes are implicated in kidney disease; yet, Ontario's existing gene panel options includes fewer than 45 genes. Despite growing evidence for genetic testing in CKD care, testing is not systematically integrated into the diagnostic pathway. Standardized testing and clear eligibility criteria are needed to improve diagnosis, care, and outcomes. In 2023, Ontario Health's Provincial Genetics Program convened a Renal Genetics Expert Group to develop standardized genetic testing criteria and evidence-based multigene panels for CKD. This initiative aims to support equitable access to high-quality genetic services and improve clinical outcomes through early, accurate diagnoses. An environmental scan of provincial, national, and international guidelines informed the development of a testing framework. Literature review and expert consensus guided the creation of eligibility criteria and panel content. Input from nephrologists, geneticists, genetic counsellors, and patients was incorporated throughout the process. Standardized recommendations for genetic testing in CKD promote consistent, equitable access to diagnostics across Ontario. Careful curation of multigene panels that align with current knowledge of gene-disease associations and patient phenotypes, can help streamline testing. Integration of this framework into clinical care will strengthen collaboration between nephrology and genetics, facilitate earlier diagnosis, and support personalized management, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals with CKD.",

      "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the multisystem disease central to the COVID-19 pandemic. As patients receiving in-center maintenance hemodialysis require treatment 3 times weekly, they were unable to fully isolate. It was important for in-center hemodialysis units to implement robust infection control practices to ensure patient safety and minimize risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 among patients and staff. There are 27 renal programs within Ontario, Canada, providing care for about 9000 people across about 100 in-center hemodialysis units. These units are funded by the Ontario Renal Network (ORN), which is part of the provincial agency Ontario Health. The objective was to track infection control practices that were implemented by in-center hemodialysis units and be able to provide a descriptive narrative of the COVID-19 pandemic response of Ontario's hemodialysis units between March and September 2020. Between May and September 2020, data were collected from Ontario's 27 renal programs on the implementation of key infection control practices, including symptom screening, use of personal protective equipment, testing, practices specifically related to patients from congregate living settings, other prevention practices, and outbreak management. There were 4 data collection cycles, each approximately 1 month apart. The results were compiled and shared across the province, and infection control practices were also discussed at provincial COVID-19 teleconferences hosted by the ORN. By March 2020, all but one renal program had implemented one or more forms of symptom screening, all renal programs had implemented physical distancing in waiting rooms and restricted visitors, and 74% of renal programs had implemented universal masking for all staff. By April 2020, 89% of renal programs had implemented universal masking for all patients, 52% had implemented enhanced contact and droplet precautions for suspected or positive cases, and 59% of renal programs tested all patients from congregate living settings regularly (with a low symptom threshold for testing). Infection control practices became more homogeneous across renal programs over time, and most practices were in place as of the last data collection. The renal system in Ontario was able to respond quickly within the first 2 months of the pandemic to minimize the spread of COVID-19 within in-center hemodialysis units. Through provincial teleconferences, infection control practices were shared across the province as the pandemic and hemodialysis unit responses evolved. This supported renal programs to advocate locally if their hospital was lagging in practices felt to be of value in other hemodialysis units. Although no direct correlation can be made regarding the implementation of infection control practices within in-center hemodialysis units and the number of COVID-19 cases in this population, the limited number of outbreaks in hemodialysis units may have been influenced by the proactive response of renal programs. Practices described in this article may support management and response to subsequent waves of COVID-19 or future similar infectious diseases.",

On the basis of available pharmacological data, we developed a modified low-dose regimen of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir 300/100 mg on day 1, followed by 150/100 mg daily from day 2 to 5. In this study, we report our experience with this modified dose regimen in dialysis patients in the Canadian province of Ontario. We included dialysis patients who developed COVID-19 and were treated with the modified dose nirmatrelvir/ritonavir regimen during a 60-day period between April 1 and May 31, 2022. Details of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use and outcomes were captured manually, and demographic data were obtained from a provincial database. Data are presented with descriptive statistics. The principal outcomes we describe are 30-day hospitalization, 30-day mortality, and required medication changes with the modified dose regimen. A total of 134 dialysis patients with COVID-19 received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir during the period of study. Fifty-six percent were men, and the mean age was 64 years. Most common symptoms were cough and/or sore throat (60%). Medication interactions were common with calcium channel blockers, statins being the most frequent. Most patients (128, 96%) were able to complete the course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and none of the patients who received nirmatrelvir/ritonavir died of COVID-19 in the 30 days of follow-up.

Vaccine effectiveness after a third dose versus two doses for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 in the hemodialysis population against Omicron is not known. We conducted a retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between December 1, 2021, and February 28, 2022, in the maintenance hemodialysis population who had received two versus three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection, and related hospitalization and death were determined from provincial databases. The primary outcome was the first RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the secondary outcome was a SARS-CoV-2-related severe outcome, defined as either hospitalization or death. A total of 8457 individuals receiving in-center hemodialysis were included. At study initiation, 2334 (28%) individuals received three doses, which increased to 7468 (88%) individuals by the end of the study period.

      "abstract": "Home dialysis modalities (home hemodialysis [HD] and peritoneal dialysis [PD]) are associated with greater patient autonomy and treatment satisfaction compared with in-center modalities, yet the level of home-dialysis use worldwide is low. Reasons for limited utilization are context-dependent, informed by local resources, dialysis costs, access to healthcare, health system policies, provider bias or preferences, cultural beliefs, individual lifestyle concerns, potential care-partner time, and financial burdens. In May 2021, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) convened a controversies conference on home dialysis, focusing on how modality choice and distribution are determined and strategies to expand home-dialysis use. Participants recognized that expanding use of home dialysis within a given health system requires alignment of policy, fiscal resources, organizational structure, provider incentives, and accountability. Clinical outcomes across all dialysis modalities are largely similar, but for specific clinical measures, one modality may have advantages over another. Therefore, choice among available modalities is preference-sensitive, with consideration of quality of life, life goals, clinical characteristics, family or care-partner support, and living environment. Ideally, individuals, their care-partners, and their healthcare teams will employ shared decision-making in assessing initial and subsequent kidney failure treatment options. To meet this goal, iterative, high-quality education and support for healthcare professionals, patients, and care-partners are priorities. Everyone who faces dialysis should have access to home therapy. Facilitating universal access to home dialysis and expanding utilization requires alignment of policy considerations and resources at the dialysis-center level, with clear leadership from informed and motivated clinical teams.",

      "abstract": "People with advanced CKD are at high risk of mortality and morbidity from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We measured rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severe outcomes in a large population attending advanced CKD clinics during the first 21 months of the pandemic. We examined risk factors for infection and case fatality, and we assessed vaccine effectiveness in this population. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data on demographics, diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection rates, outcomes, and associated risk factors, including vaccine effectiveness, for people attending a province-wide network of advanced CKD clinics during the first four waves of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. In a population of 20,235 patients with advanced CKD, 607 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection over 21 months. The case fatality rate at 30 days was 19% overall but declined from 29% in the first wave to 14% in the fourth. Hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rates were 41% and 12%, respectively, and 4% started long-term dialysis within 90 days. Significant risk factors for diagnosed infection on multivariable analysis included lower eGFR, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, attending advanced CKD clinics for more than 2 years, non-White ethnicity, lower income, living in the Greater Toronto Area, and long-term care home residency. Being doubly vaccinated was associated with lower 30-day case fatality rate (odds ratio [OR], 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 0.52). Older age (OR, 1.06 per year; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.08) and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (OR, 1.11 per unit; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.23) were associated with higher 30-day case fatality rate. People attending advanced CKD clinics and diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first 21 months of the pandemic had high case fatality and hospitalization rates. Fatality rates were significantly lower in those who were doubly vaccinated.

      "abstract": "People living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including higher rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Data on responsiveness to COVID-19 vaccination strategies and immunogenicity are limited, yet required to inform vaccination strategies in this at-risk population. The objective of this study is to characterize the longitudinal serologic response to COVID-19 vaccination. This is a prospective observational cohort study. Participating outpatient kidney programs within Ontario and British Columbia. Up to 2500 participants with CKD G3b-5D receiving COVID-19 vaccination, including participants receiving dialysis and kidney transplant recipients (CKD G1T-5T). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies (anti-spike, anti-receptor binding domain, anti-nucleocapsid) will be detected by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) from serum or dried blood spot testing. In a subset of participants, neutralizing antibodies against novel variants of concern will be evaluated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected for exploratory immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular immunity. Participants will be recruited prior to or following any COVID-19 vaccine dose and have blood sampled for serological testing at multiple timepoints: 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post vaccination. When possible, samples will be collected prior to a dose or booster. Participants will remain in the study for at least 1 year following their last COVID-19 vaccine dose. The adaptive design of this study allows for planned modification based on emerging evidence or rapid changes in public health policy surrounding vaccination. Limitations include incomplete earlier timepoints for blood collection due to rapid vaccination of the population. This large multicenter serologic study of participants living with kidney disease will generate data on the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 immune response to vaccination across the spectrum of CKD, providing insights into the amplitude and duration of immunity conferred by COVID-19 vaccination and allowing for characterization of factors associated with immune response. The results of this study may be used to inform immunization guidelines and public health recommendations for the 4 million Canadians living with CKD.

      "abstract": "Advocacy and policy change are powerful levers to improve quality of care and better support patients on home dialysis. While the kidney community increasingly recognizes the value of home dialysis as an option for patients who prioritize independence and flexibility, only a minority of patients dialyze at home in the United States. Complex system-level factors have restricted further growth in home dialysis modalities, including limited infrastructure, insufficient staff for patient education and training, patient-specific barriers, and suboptimal physician expertise. In this article, we outline trends in home dialysis use, review our evolving understanding of what constitutes high-quality care for the home dialysis population (as well as how this can be measured), and discuss policy and advocacy efforts that continue to shape the care of US patients and compare them with experiences in other countries. We conclude by discussing future directions for quality and advocacy efforts.",

      "abstract": "The rates of long-term mortality, reinfection, cardiovascular outcomes, and hospitalization were high among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors on maintenance dialysis. Several risk factors, including intensive care unit admission related to COVID-19 and reinfection, were found to have a prolonged effect on survival. This study shows that the burden of COVID-19 remains high after the period of acute infection in the population receiving maintenance dialysis. Many questions remain about the population receiving maintenance dialysis who survived coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous literature has focused on outcomes associated with the initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, but it may underestimate the effect of disease. This study describes the long-term morbidity and mortality among patients receiving maintenance dialysis in Ontario, Canada, who survived SARS-CoV-2 infection and the risk factors associated with long-term mortality. We conducted a population-based cohort study of patients receiving maintenance dialysis in Ontario, Canada, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and survived 30 days between March 14, 2020, and December 1, 2021 (pre-Omicron), with follow-up until September 30, 2022. Our primary outcome was all-cause mortality while our secondary outcomes included reinfection, composite of cardiovascular (CV)&#x2013;related death or hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, and admission to long-term care or complex continuing care. We also examined risk factors associated with long-term mortality using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. We included 798 COVID-19 survivors receiving maintenance dialysis. After the first 30 days of infection, death occurred at a rate of 15.0 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.9 to 17.5) over a median follow-up of 1.4 years (interquartile range, 1.1&#x2013;1.7) with a nadir of death at approximately 0.5 years. Reinfection, composite CV death or hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalization occurred at a rate (95% CI) of 15.9 (13.6 to 18.5), 17.4 (14.9 to 20.4), and 73.1 (66.6 to 80.2) per 100 person-years, respectively. In addition to traditional predictors of mortality, intensive care unit admission for COVID-19 had a prolonged effect on survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 4.3). Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 among 30-day survivors increased all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.3). The burden of COVID-19 persists beyond the period of acute infection in the population receiving maintenance dialysis in Ontario with high rates of death, reinfection, all-cause hospitalization, and CV disease among COVID-19 survivors.",

      "abstract": "There is concern regarding the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the maintenance dialysis population. This study describes the long-term morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 among patients receiving maintenance dialysis in comparison to uninfected controls. We conducted a population-based cohort study of patients receiving maintenance dialysis in Ontario, Canada, between March 14, 2020, and December 1, 2021 (pre-Omicron), with follow-up until March 31, 2023. We accounted for confounding using propensity-scores to match each patient with COVID-19 to four uninfected controls. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included subsequent COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 associated death, composite of cardiovascular (CV)-related death or hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, and admission to long-term care, or complex continuing care. Our matched cohort included 3,340 maintenance dialysis patients: 668 with COVID-19 and 2,672 controls. Over a median of 1.8 years of follow-up, the rate of long-term all-cause mortality for 90-day COVID-19 survivors was 11.9 deaths per 100 person-years which did not differ from 13.9 deaths per 100 person-years in those without COVID-19 infection; hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, (95% CI 0.72 to 1.03). Similarly, no significant difference was observed on a composite outcome of cardiovascular death or hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, long-term care or complex continuing care placement. Prior COVID-19 infection was associated with a reduced risk of subsequent COVID-19 infection (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.88). Subsequent COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher rate of death (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.42 to 1.98). Individuals receiving maintenance dialysis who survived their initial COVID-19 infection did not have an increased long-term risk of death, all-cause hospitalization, or cardiovascular disease compared to those without COVID-19. Subsequent COVID-19 infection during follow-up, however, was associated with increased mortality.",

      "abstract": "Incremental peritoneal dialysis (PD) is increasingly advocated to reduce treatment burden and costs, with potential to better preserve residual kidney function. Global prevalence of incremental PD use is unknown and use in Australia and New Zealand has not been reported. Binational registry analysis including incident adult PD patients in Australia and New Zealand (2007-2017), examining incidence of and outcomes associated with incremental PD (first recorded PD exchange volume &lt;42 L/week (incremental) vs. &#x2265;42 L/week (standard)). Incremental PD use significantly increased from 2.7% of all incident PD in 2007 to 11.1% in 2017 (mean increase 0.84%/year). Duration of incremental PD use was 1 year or less in 67% of cases. Male sex, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) or M&#x101;ori ethnicities, age 45-59 years, medical comorbidities or treatment at a centre with low use of automated PD or icodextrin was associated with lower incidence of incremental PD use. Low body mass index and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate was associated with higher incidence. After accounting for patient and centre variables, commencing PD with an incremental prescription was associated with reduced peritonitis risk (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.86).When kidney transplantation and death were considered as competing risks, the association between incremental PD and peritonitis was not significant (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 0.91, 95%CI 0.71-1.17, <i>p</i> = 0.5), however cumulative incidence of 30-day transfer to haemodialysis was lower in those receiving incremental PD (SHR 0.73, 95%CI 0.56-0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.01). There was no association between incremental PD and death. Incremental PD use is increasing in Australia and New Zealand and is not associated with patient harm.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the association of intra-abdominal adhesions with the risk of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter complications. Individuals undergoing laparoscopic PD catheter insertion were prospectively enrolled from eight centers in Canada and the United States. Patients were grouped based on the presence of adhesions observed during catheter insertion. The primary outcome was the composite of PD never starting, termination of PD, or the need for an invasive procedure caused by flow restriction or abdominal pain. Seven hundred and fifty-eight individuals were enrolled, of whom 201 (27%) had adhesions during laparoscopic PD catheter insertion. The risk of the primary outcome occurred in 35 (17%) in the adhesion group compared with 58 (10%) in the no adhesion group (adjusted HR, 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 2.55) within 6 months of insertion. Lower abdominal or pelvic adhesions had an adjusted HR of 1.80 (95% CI, 1.09 to 2.98) compared with the no adhesion group. Invasive procedures were required in 26 (13%) and 47 (8%) of the adhesion and no adhesion groups, respectively (unadjusted HR, 1.60: 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.47) within 6 months of insertion. The adjusted odds ratio for adhesions for women was 1.65 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.41), for body mass index per 5 kg/m 2 was 1.16 (95% CI, 1.003 to 1.34), and for prior abdominal surgery was 8.34 (95% CI, 5.5 to 12.34). Common abnormalities found during invasive procedures included PD catheter tip migration, occlusion of the lumen with fibrin, omental wrapping, adherence to the bowel, and the development of new adhesions. People with intra-abdominal adhesions undergoing PD catheter insertion were at higher risk for abdominal pain or flow restriction preventing PD from starting, PD termination, or requiring an invasive procedure. However, most patients, with or without adhesions, did not experience complications, and most complications did not lead to the termination of PD therapy.",

      "abstract": "A history of prior abdominal procedures may influence the likelihood of referral for peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion. To guide clinical decision making in this population, this study examined the association between prior abdominal procedures and outcomes in patients undergoing PD catheter insertion. Retrospective cohort study. Adults undergoing their first PD catheter insertion between November 1, 2011, and November 1, 2020, at 11 institutions in Canada and the United States participating in the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis North American Catheter Registry. Prior abdominal procedure(s) defined as any procedure that enters the peritoneal cavity. The primary outcome was time to the first of (1) abandonment of the PD catheter or (2) interruption/termination of PD. Secondary outcomes were rates of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and procedures. Cumulative incidence curves were used to describe the risk over time, and an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between the exposure and primary outcome. Models for count data were used to estimate the associations between the exposure and secondary outcomes. Of 855 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 31% had a history of a prior abdominal procedure and 20% experienced at least 1 PD catheter-related complication that led to the primary outcome. Prior abdominal procedures were not associated with an increased risk of the primary outcome (adjusted HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.68-1.84). Upper-abdominal procedures were associated with a higher adjusted hazard of the primary outcome, but there was no dose-response relationship concerning the number of procedures. There was no association between prior abdominal procedures and other secondary outcomes. Observational study and cohort limited to a sample of patients believed to be potential candidates for PD catheter insertion. A history of prior abdominal procedure(s) does not appear to influence catheter outcomes following PD catheter insertion. Such a history should not be a contraindication to PD. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a life-saving therapy for individuals with kidney failure that can be done at home. PD requires the placement of a tube, or catheter, into the abdomen to allow the exchange of dialysis fluid during treatment. There is concern that individuals who have undergone prior abdominal procedures and are referred for a catheter might have scarring that could affect catheter function. In some institutions, they might not even be offered PD therapy as an option. In this study, we found that a history of prior abdominal procedures did not increase the risk of PD catheter complications and should not dissuade patients from choosing PD or providers from recommending it.",

      "abstract": "This case report discusses the complex management of a 46-year-old man with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and severe neuropathic complications, which led to bilateral leg amputations. The patient experienced persistent diarrhea due to diabetic neuropathy, significantly impairing his daily functioning. Despite transitioning from hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis, the diarrhea persisted. A colostomy was subsequently performed, which, although it did not completely resolve the diarrhea, allowed for better control, improving the patient's self-care and independence. Notably, the catheter exit site was maintained on the opposite side of the abdomen. Despite initial concerns about the feasibility of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in patients with stomas, including the challenges of creating a stoma in patients with an existing PD catheter, this case demonstrates the successful continuation of PD following a colostomy. Traditionally, intestinal stomas have been viewed as a relative contraindication to PD due to risks such as leakage and infection. However, current guidelines recommend using extended catheters with a presternal exit site to minimize these risks. The patient's quality of life improved significantly after the colostomy, with no major complications observed during follow-up. This report underscores the importance of tailoring treatment to individual patient needs, balancing risks with potential well-being benefits, and highlights the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration and adherence to best practices. Given the limited literature on PD in patients with intestinal stomas, this case contributes valuable clinical insights for future management.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundTechnique survival, also reported with negative connotations as technique failure or transfer from peritoneal dialysis to haemodialysis, has been identified by patients, caregivers and health professionals as a critically important outcome to be reported in all trials. However, there is wide variation in how peritoneal dialysis technique survival is defined, measured and reported, leading to difficulty in comparing or consolidating results.MethodsWe conducted an online international consensus workshop to establish a core outcome measure of technique survival. Discussions were analysed thematically.ResultsFifty-five participants including 14 patients and caregivers from 13 countries took part in facilitated breakout discussions using video-conferencing. The following themes were identified: capturing important aspects of the outcome (requiring a core event to define the outcome, distinguishing temporary from permanent events, recognising heterogeneous experiences of transfers), adopting appropriate neutral nomenclature (conveying with clarity, avoiding negative connotations), and ensuring feasibility and applicability (capturing data relevant to clinical and research settings, ease of adoption). The suggested definitions for the core outcome measure were 'the event of a transfer to haemodialysis', or 'discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis'. Applying the principles described within the workshop, defining the outcome measure as a 'transfer to haemodialysis' was preferable.ConclusionsIt is proposed that the core outcome of technique survival is redefined as 'transfer to haemodialysis' and that its components are standardised using simple, neutral terminology Components considered important by stakeholders included recording the reasons for transfer from peritoneal dialysis, and focussing on permanent events whilst ensuring the outcome remains easy to implement.",

This effect is inadequately appreciated, but of crucial importance to patients, their carers and the health-care systems that support them. Although many of the comorbid conditions prevalent in this patient population have the potential to affect brain structure and function, an evolving body of evidence indicates that the dialysis therapy itself has a central role in the pathophysiology of progressive cognitive impairment. Both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are associated with structural and functional changes in the brain that can lead to characteristic short-term symptoms, such as headache, confusion, delirium and brain fog, as well as long-term reductions in cognitive functional ability. Here, we explore the mechanisms, both established and putative, underlying these effects and consider approaches to addressing this issue with both single and complex therapeutic interventions.",

We examine the five devices using SPD in published literature, reviewing their design, dialysis clearance, and ultrafiltration (UF) capacity-Automated Wearable Artificial Kidney (AWAK), now called Viva Kompact since 2024, Carry Life System PD/Carry Life UF, Wearable Artificial Kidney (WEAKID), Vicenza Wearable Artificial Kidney (ViWAK), and Renart-PD. Carry Life devices and Viva Kompact have reported on human trials, WEAKID and Renart-PD on animal studies, while ViWAK has published in vitro data. All devices have published data on dialysis clearance capabilities. WEAKID and Carry Life PD achieved a high dialysate:plasma concentration gradient for small solutes. Viva Kompact and Renart-PD reported stable or lower serum concentrations of urea, creatinine, phosphate, and &#x3b2;2-microglogulin following treatments. ViWAK demonstrated removal of creatinine, B2 microglobulin, and angiogenin to &lt;10% of pre-treatment levels. UF capacity remains unknown for many devices. In human trials, Carry Life UF has achieved 863 mL UF in a 5-h treatment with the addition of 20 g/h of glucose to 1.5% dextrose dialysate. Viva Kompact has demonstrated 877 mL UF in a 9-h treatment using 1.5% dextrose dialysate in an animal model, comparable to 10-h APD, with the addition of 6.6 g/h glucose. Both devices have demonstrated improved UF per gram of glucose used. The expected use of these devices varies greatly, from an adjunct to currently available treatments to a complete replacement for current modalities. Large-scale, human studies are needed to determine their role in the future of PD delivery.",

      "abstract": "The transition from advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to dialysis is a period of heightened vulnerability for many patients. Virtual monitoring of these patients could facilitate the communication of accurate and reliable data between patients and health care providers, helping to avoid unnecessary emergency department (ED) visits and facilitate more optimal dialysis starts. To determine whether the addition of the VIEWER (Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables) platform to usual care will lead to a reduction in ED visits and hospitalizations and lead to an increase in perceived safety of virtual care among patients and providers. This study is a national, pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing usual care alone vs usual care plus the VIEWER virtual care platform in patients with advanced CKD. Given the nature of the intervention, patients and care providers will not be blinded; outcome assessment and statistical analysis will be blinded. Five CKD clinics in 2 Canadian provinces (Manitoba and Ontario). Patients with advanced CKD not on dialysis (eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 2-year kidney failure risk &gt;40%). Participants randomized to the intervention group will be provided with the VIEWER platform, comprised of a wireless blood pressure (BP) monitor, weight scale, transcutaneous O<sub>2</sub> sat (SpO2) monitor, wearable motion tracker, and mobile tablet running the VIEWER application. The intervention group will be trained to use the VIEWER platform to complete a daily self-assessment via the app (BP, weight, O<sub>2</sub> saturation, step count) and weekly Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Revised (ESAS-r) survey. These assessments will be integrated into clinical decision-making in multidisciplinary kidney health clinics. Participants will use the VIEWER platform for 12 months (or until dialysis initiation) in addition to receiving usual care. Intention-to-treat (ITT) approach will be used to compare the primary outcome between 2 study groups. Time to primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed using univariate Cox proportional hazards models and a Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test. The primary outcome is the time to first hospital admission and/or ED visit. The control is usual care (no exposure to VIEWER platform). Some individuals may face challenges with technology adoption, which could affect participation. Those without Internet access are limited in their ability to take part in this study.

      "abstract": "Approximately 480 million individuals worldwide (~6% of the global population) are Indigenous peoples. Despite their diverse cultures and histories, the shared legacy of colonialism has profoundly shaped their health and socioeconomic status. This legacy is deeply intertwined with poverty, systemic racism and historical trauma, contributing to significant health disparities compared with non-Indigenous populations. Among the many chronic diseases disproportionately affecting Indigenous peoples, chronic kidney disease (CKD) stands out as a major public health concern. Indigenous peoples experience higher rates of CKD, yet they often face barriers to accessing responsive and culturally safe health-care services. Factors such as geographic isolation, socioeconomic disadvantages and systemic discrimination limit their access to preventive care, early disease detection and kidney replacement therapy, leading to worse health outcomes and higher mortality rates. Exposure to environmental and occupational risks and inadequate infrastructure further exacerbate CKD risk for Indigenous peoples. Here, we examine determinants of kidney disease and health among major Indigenous populations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Canada, Latin America, Aotearoa-New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and the USA. We discuss culturally safe and responsive strategies that can improve the delivery of kidney care and make policy recommendations for multiple levels of government to ensure health-care systems are equipped to meet the needs of Indigenous communities. By addressing these gaps and promoting cultural competence in kidney care, health-care providers can have a crucial role in reducing health disparities and improving Indigenous peoples' kidney health worldwide.",
      "laySummary": "This research looks at kidney health among Indigenous populations around the world, highlighting significant disparities compared to non-Indigenous groups. These disparities are largely linked to historical injustices like colonialism, poverty, and limited access to healthcare, leading to higher rates of chronic kidney disease and worse outcomes. The study emphasizes the need for culturally sensitive healthcare approaches and policy changes to address these inequities and improve kidney health for Indigenous communities globally."

In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a guideline for the diagnosis and management of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data from studies assessing established and emerging therapies for the treatment of anemia and iron deficiency have become available. Beginning in 2019, KDIGO planned 2 Controversies Conferences to review the new evidence and its potential impact on the management of anemia in clinical practice. Here, we report on the second of these conferences held virtually in December 2021, which focused on a new class of agents-the hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs). This report provides a review of the consensus points and controversies from this second conference and highlights areas that warrant prioritization for future research.",

      "abstract": "There is controversy regarding the optimal renal-replacement therapy (RRT) modality for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). We conducted a secondary analysis of the STandard versus Accelerated Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial to compare outcomes among patients who initiated RRT with either continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). We generated a propensity score for the likelihood of receiving CRRT and used inverse probability of treatment with overlap-weighting to address baseline inter-group differences. The primary outcome was a composite of death or RRT dependence at 90-days after randomization. We identified 1590 trial participants who initially received CRRT and 606 who initially received IHD. The composite outcome of death or RRT dependence at 90-days occurred in 823 (51.8%) patients who commenced CRRT and 329 (54.3%) patients who commenced IHD (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.75-1.09). After balancing baseline characteristics with overlap weighting, initial receipt of CRRT was associated with a lower risk of death or RRT dependence at 90-days compared with initial receipt of IHD (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.66-0.99). This association was predominantly driven by a lower risk of RRT dependence at 90-days (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.39-0.94). In critically ill patients with severe AKI, initiation of CRRT, as compared to IHD, was associated with a significant reduction in the composite outcome of death or RRT dependence at 90-days.",

      "abstract": "People with HIV are at a greater risk of end-stage kidney disease than the general population. Considering the risk of death after end-stage kidney disease, access to renal transplantation in people with HIV is critically important. We included all adult patients on chronic dialysis in Ontario, Canada, between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2020. We determined the probability of kidney transplantation with competing risk of death over time since the initiation of dialysis by calculating the adjusted subdistribution hazard ratios (sdHR; 95% confidence interval [CI]). We also compared long-term renal allograft and posttransplant mortality outcomes between HIV-negative and HIV-positive persons. Of 40 686 people (median age, 68 years; interquartile range, 57-77; 38.4% women), 173 were HIV-positive and 40 513 were HIV-negative. The incidence of kidney transplantation in HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients was 40.5 (95% CI, 39.4-41.6)/1000 person-years and 35.0 (95% CI, 22.8-53.7)/1000 person-years, respectively (<i>P</i> = .51). Considering the competing risk of death, HIV-positive people had a significantly lower chance of receiving kidney transplants than HIV-negative people (sdHR, 0.46 [95% CI, .30-.70]). The long-term allograft failure risk was not significantly different between HIV-negative and HIV-positive people, considering the competing risk of posttransplant death (sdHR, 1.71 [95% CI, .46-6.35]). Although the incidence and crude probability of kidney transplantation were similar among HIV-negative and HIV-positive persons in this cohort, those with HIV had a significantly lower likelihood of kidney transplantation than those without HIV. Having HIV was not significantly associated with a poor long-term allograft outcome compared with patients without HIV.",

      "abstract": "The spectrum of cardiorenal and metabolic diseases comprises many disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease (CKD), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), dyslipidemias, hypertension, and associated comorbidities such as pulmonary diseases and metabolism dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolism dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASLD and MASH, respectively, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NAFLD and NASH]). Because cardiorenal and metabolic diseases share pathophysiologic pathways, two or more are often present in the same individual. Findings from recent outcome trials have demonstrated benefits of various treatments across a range of conditions, suggesting a need for practice recommendations that will guide clinicians to better manage complex conditions involving diabetes, cardiorenal, and/or metabolic (DCRM) diseases. To meet this need, we formed an international volunteer task force comprising leading cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to develop the DCRM 2.0 Practice Recommendations, an updated and expanded revision of a previously published multispecialty consensus on the comprehensive management of persons living with DCRM. The recommendations are presented as 22 separate graphics covering the essentials of management to improve general health, control cardiorenal risk factors, and manage cardiorenal and metabolic comorbidities, leading to improved patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Kidney transplant recipients with graft failure (KTR-GF) and those with a failing graft are an increasingly prevalent group of patients. Their clinical management is complex, and outcomes are worse than transplant na&#xef;ve patients on dialysis. In 2023, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization reported findings from a controversies conference and identified several clinical practice priorities for KTR-GF. As an exercise in needs assessment, we aimed to collate and summarize current practices in adult Canadian kidney transplant programs around these KDIGO-identified clinical practice priorities. Environmental scan followed by content analysis. Canadian adult kidney transplant programs. We categorized the themes of our content analysis around 7 clinical practice priorities: (1) determining prognosis and kidney failure trajectory; (2) immunosuppression management; (3) management of medical complications; (4) preparing for return to dialysis; (5) evaluation and listing for re-transplantation; (6) management of psychological effects; and (7) transition to supportive care. We solicited documents that identified each program's current care practices for KTR-GF or patients with a failing graft, including policies, procedures, pathways, and protocols. A content analysis of documents and informal correspondence (email or telephone conversations) was done to extract information surrounding the 7 practice priorities. Of the 18 programs contacted, 12 transplant programs participated in this study and a document from a provincial organization (where 2 non-responding programs are located) was procured and included in this analysis. Overall, practice gaps and discrepancies were noted. Many participants highlighted the lack of evidence or consensus to guide the management of KTR-GF as the key reason. Immunosuppression management was the most frequently addressed priority. Six programs and the provincial document recommended a nuanced approach to immunosuppressant management based on clinical factors and re-transplant candidacy. Two programs used the Kidney Failure Risk Equation and eGFR to determine referral trajectories and prepare patients for return to dialysis. Exact processes outlining medical management during the transition were not found except for nephrectomy indications and in 1 program that has a specific transition clinic for KTR-GF. All programs have a formal or informal policy that KTR-GF should be assessed for re-transplantation. Referrals for psychological support and transition to supportive care were made on a case-by-case basis. Our environmental scan was at risk of non-response bias and restricted to transplant programs. Kidney clinics and dialysis units may have relevant policies and procedures that were not examined. The findings from our environmental scan suggest gaps in care and potential areas for quality improvement, including a lack of multidisciplinary care, structured dialysis preparation and psychological support. There is also a need to prioritize research that generates evidence to guide the management of KTR-GF and contributes to the aim of developing clinical practice guidelines. Les receveurs d&#x2019;une greffe r&#xe9;nale avec perte du greffon (RGR-PG) et ceux dont le greffon est d&#xe9;faillant constituent un groupe de patients de plus en plus r&#xe9;pandu. La prise en charge clinique de ces patients est complexe et les r&#xe9;sultats sont moins bons que ceux des patients dialys&#xe9;s na&#xef;fs de transplantation. En 2023, l&#x2019;organisme KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) a pr&#xe9;sent&#xe9; les r&#xe9;sultats d&#x2019;une conf&#xe9;rence portant sur les controverses et a identifi&#xe9; plusieurs priorit&#xe9;s de pratique clinique pour les RGR-PG. Dans le cadre d&#x2019;un exercice d&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation des besoins, nous avons voulu rassembler et r&#xe9;sumer les pratiques actuelles dans les programs canadiens de transplantation r&#xe9;nale chez les adultes en lien avec les priorit&#xe9;s de pratique clinique identifi&#xe9;es par le KDIGO. Analyze contextuelle suivie d&#x2019;une analyze du contenu. Les programs canadiens de transplantation r&#xe9;nale chez l&#x2019;adulte. Nous avons class&#xe9; les th&#xe8;mes de l&#x2019;analyze de contenu autour de sept priorit&#xe9;s de pratique clinique: 1) la d&#xe9;termination du pronostic et de la trajectoire de l&#x2019;insuffisance r&#xe9;nale; 2) la gestion du traitement immunosuppresseur; 3) la prise en charge des complications m&#xe9;dicales; 4) la pr&#xe9;paration au retour &#xe0; la dialyze; 5) l&#x2019;&#xe9;valuation et l&#x2019;inscription pour la retransplantation; 6) la gestion des effets psychologiques; et 7) la transition vers les soins de soutien. Nous avons sollicit&#xe9; les documents (politiques, proc&#xe9;dures, parcours, protocoles) des programs de transplantation qui d&#xe9;crivent les pratiques de soins actuelles pour les RGR-PG ou les patients avec un greffon d&#xe9;faillant. Une analyze du contenu de ces documents et de la correspondance informelle (courriels ou conversations t&#xe9;l&#xe9;phoniques) a &#xe9;t&#xe9; effectu&#xe9;e pour en extraire les donn&#xe9;es sur les sept priorit&#xe9;s de pratique. Des 18 programmes de transplantation contact&#xe9;s, 12 ont particip&#xe9; &#xe0; l&#x2019;&#xe9;tude et un seul document provenant d&#x2019;une organisation provinciale (o&#xf9; se trouvent deux programmes n&#x2019;ayant pas particip&#xe9;) a &#xe9;t&#xe9; obtenu et inclus dans l&#x2019;analyse. Dans l&#x2019;ensemble, on a observ&#xe9; plusieurs lacunes et divergences dans la pratique. La principale raison donn&#xe9;e par plusieurs participants &#xe9;tant le manque de donn&#xe9;es ou de consensus pour guider la prise en charge des RGR-PG. La gestion du traitement immunosuppresseur &#xe9;tait la priorit&#xe9; la plus fr&#xe9;quemment abord&#xe9;e. Le document provincial et six programmes recommandaient une approche nuanc&#xe9;e, fond&#xe9;e sur les facteurs cliniques et la candidature &#xe0; la retransplantation, pour la gestion du traitement immunosuppresseur. Deux programmes utilisaient l&#x2019;&#xe9;quation KFRE (Kidney Failure Risk Equation) et le DFGe pour aiguiller les patients et les pr&#xe9;parer &#xe0; retourner en dialyse. Nous n&#x2019;avons pas trouv&#xe9; de processus pr&#xe9;cis d&#xe9;crivant sp&#xe9;cifiquement la prise en charge m&#xe9;dicale pendant la transition, mis &#xe0; part dans les indications de n&#xe9;phrectomie et un programme ayant une clinique de transition sp&#xe9;cifique aux RGR-PG. Tous les programmes disposent d&#x2019;une politique formelle ou informelle indiquant que les RGR-PG doivent &#xea;tre &#xe9;valu&#xe9;s pour la retransplantation. Les aiguillages vers du soutien psychologique et la transition vers les soins de soutien sont trait&#xe9;s au cas par cas. L&#x2019;analyse contextuelle pr&#xe9;sentait un risque de biais de non-r&#xe9;ponse et elle a &#xe9;t&#xe9; limit&#xe9;e aux programmes de transplantation. Les cliniques de soins r&#xe9;naux et les unit&#xe9;s de dialyse pourraient disposer de politiques et de proc&#xe9;dures pertinentes qui n&#x2019;ont pas &#xe9;t&#xe9; examin&#xe9;es. Les r&#xe9;sultats de l&#x2019;analyse contextuelle sugg&#xe8;rent qu&#x2019;il existe des lacunes dans les soins et de possibles domaines d&#x2019;am&#xe9;lioration de la qualit&#xe9;. On a notamment observ&#xe9; un manque de soins multidisciplinaires, de pr&#xe9;paration structur&#xe9;e &#xe0; la dialyse et de soutien psychologique. Il est &#xe9;galement n&#xe9;cessaire de prioriser la recherche produisant des donn&#xe9;es probantes afin de guider la prise en charge des RGR-PG et l&#x2019;&#xe9;laboration de lignes directrices de pratique clinique.",

      "abstract": "Is performing a large definitive trial to establish the optimal anticoagulation strategy in dialysis recipients with atrial fibrillation feasible? One hundred fifty-one patients at 28 dialysis centers were enrolled and randomized to apixaban (<i>n</i>=51), warfarin (<i>n</i>=52), or no oral anticoagulation (<i>n</i>=48). Despite coronavirus disease&#x2013;related pauses, recruitment was completed in 30 months, with 83% of participants completing follow-up in their assigned treatment arm. Atrial fibrillation is common in individuals receiving dialysis. The role of oral anticoagulation in this population is uncertain given its exclusion from previous seminal clinical trials. Our objective was to determine the feasibility of performing a large definitive trial to establish the optimal anticoagulation strategy in individuals with atrial fibrillation receiving dialysis. The Strategies for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Receiving Dialysis trial was a parallel-group, open-label, allocation-concealed, pilot randomized control trial that took place at 28 centers in Canada and Australia. The trial included adults (18 years or older) undergoing dialysis with a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who met the CHADS-65 criteria. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive dose-adjusted warfarin, apixaban 5 mg twice daily, or no oral anticoagulation and followed for 26 weeks. The primary outcomes evaluated the following measures of feasibility: (<i>1</i>) recruitment of the target population within 2 years from the start of the trial and (<i>2</i>) adherence of &gt;80% of randomized patients to the allocated treatment strategy at the conclusion of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included stroke and bleeding. From December 2019 to June 2022, 151 patients were enrolled and randomized to apixaban (<i>n</i>=51), warfarin (<i>n</i>=52), or no oral anticoagulation (<i>n</i>=48). Allowing for pauses related to the coronavirus disease pandemic, recruitment was completed in 30 months, and 123 (83%) of participants completed follow-up in their allocated treatment arm. There was one adjudicated stroke event. Eight participants had a major bleeding event (four warfarin, two apixaban, two no oral anticoagulation). Death occurred in 15 participants (nine warfarin, two apixaban, four no oral anticoagulation). Time in the therapeutic range for warfarin recipients was 58% (interquartile range, 47%&#x2013;70%). We have demonstrated the feasibility of recruitment and adherence in a trial that compared different anticoagulation strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving dialysis.

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health priority affecting almost 1 billion people. New therapeutic options and clinical trial innovations such as adaptive platform trials provide an opportunity to efficiently test combination therapies. To describe the design and baseline results of the Global Kidney Patient Trials Network (GKPTN) and the design and structure of the global adaptive platform clinical trial Chronic Kidney Disease Adaptive Platform Trial Investigating Various Agents for Therapeutic Effect (CAPTIVATE) to find new therapeutic options and treatments for people with kidney disease. The GKPTN is a multicenter registry that started in May 2020 and is ongoing, while CAPTIVATE is a multicenter, multifactorial, phase 3, placebo-controlled adaptive platform randomized clinical trial that includes patients with CKD. The first participant was randomized in September 2024. The GKPTN recruits patients from kidney and endocrinology practices, and CAPTIVATE aims to recruit patients from GKPTN sites where possible. Both the GKPTN and CAPTIVATE recruit patients with nondialysis CKD. CAPTIVATE will test several investigational agents or combinations of agents, beginning with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The GKPTN monitors clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcomes to identify eligible clinical trial participants and provide a contemporary global picture of patients with CKD. The primary outcome of CAPTIVATE is to identify investigational agents or combinations of agents to reduce the rate of chronic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline. The default maximum sample size per treatment arm in each domain, based on bayesian simulations, is 500 participants, providing&#x2009;approximately 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful improvement of 2.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 in eGFR at the end of the 104-week study period. The GKPTN has enrolled 4334 patients across 119 sites in 8 countries (US, Australia, Argentina, China, Italy, Canada, Spain, and Japan). The mean (SD) participant age at enrollment was 64.5 (16.2) years, 2542 participants (58.7%) were female, and diabetic kidney disease was most frequently reported among patients for CKD etiology (1875 [43.3%]). Among the participants, the mean (SD) eGFR was 52.9 (29.3) mL/min/1.73 m2, and the median urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 89 mg/g (coefficient of variation, 20-420 mg/g). In the GKPTN cohort, the mean eGFR decline was steeper among participants with a baseline eGFR of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more (-2.29 [95% CI, -3.14 to -1.44]) compared with those with an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (-1.16 [95% CI, -1.77 to -1.44]) and was progressively steeper in more severe albuminuria subgroups. The GKPTN registry and the CAPTIVATE trial have the potential to expand and optimize therapeutic options for people with CKD using an adaptive platform clinical trial design.

      "abstract": "Among critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury (AKI) who lack emergent indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT), a strategy of preemptive RRT initiation does not lead to improved outcomes. However, for patients with persistent AKI and without urgent indications for RRT, the safety of prolonged delays in RRT initiation is unclear. We sought to assess the association between progressively longer delays in RRT initiation and clinical outcomes. A post hoc secondary analysis. The multinational STandard vs. Accelerated initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury (STARRT-AKI) trial. Participants allocated to the standard strategy of the STARRT-AKI trial. The exposure was time from randomization to RRT initiation, evaluated in quartiles and as a continuous variable. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were RRT dependence, RRT-free days, and hospital-free days, all at 90 days, as well length of ICU and hospital stay. Of the 1462 participants allocated to the standard strategy group, 903 (62%) received RRT. Median time (interquartile range) to RRT initiation was 12.1 hours (8.3-13.8&#x2009;hr), 24.5 hours (21.8-26.5&#x2009;hr), 46.8 hours (35.2-52.1&#x2009;hr), and 96.1 hours (76.7-139.2&#x2009;hr) in quartiles 1-4, respectively. Prolonged time to RRT initiation was associated with a lower risk of death at 90 days (quartile 4 vs. 1: adjusted odds ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.42-0.94]); further analyses using cubic splines and inverse probability weighting to account for immortal time bias showed no association with the risk of death. There was no association between time to RRT initiation and RRT-free days, hospital-free days, or lengths of ICU or hospital stay. Longer delay to RRT initiation had a linear association with RRT dependence at 90 days. Among patients with no urgent indications and who received RRT in the standard strategy of the STARRT-AKI trial, longer deferral of RRT initiation was not associated with a higher risk of mortality.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at whether delaying treatment with dialysis (renal replacement therapy) for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who didn't have immediate reasons to start dialysis. Researchers found that for these patients, it doesn't seem to be harmful to wait longer before starting dialysis, and in fact, delaying treatment slightly might even be associated with a lower risk of death. However, longer delays were linked to a higher chance of needing dialysis in the future."

      "abstract": "Hyperkalemia is a common complication of taking a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi). Post hoc analyses of large randomized clinical trials suggested that the addition of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) may attenuate this risk. It is unknown if this observation extends to daily clinical practice. To evaluate the association between SGLT2i initiation and hyperkalemia in individuals receiving RAASi with a background of diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2021. The cohort comprised adults 66 years and older who were prescribed a RAASi and had a history of diabetes or heart failure, an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and/or a urine albumin to creatinine ratio of greater than 30 mg/mmol. The data were analyzed between March 28, 2023, and March 22, 2024. The study exposure was a new prescription of an SGLT2i compared to noninitiation of an SGLT2i. Inverse probability of treatment weighting by a propensity score for the receipt of SGLT2i was used to achieve balance of baseline covariates in both exposure groups. The primary study outcome was hyperkalemia, defined as a serum potassium of greater than 5.5 mEq/L or an administrative code for an inpatient or outpatient encounter with hyperkalemia within 1 year of the index date. A total of 20&#x202f;063 individuals who initiated an SGLT2i (mean [SD] age, 76.9 [6.6] years; 12&#x202f;020 [59.9%] male) were compared to a pseudopopulation of 19&#x202f;781 nonusers (mean [SD] age, 76.8 [7.0] years; 11&#x202f;731 [59.3%] male). In the overall cohort, 95% had diabetes, 17% had heart failure, and 32% had stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease. SGLT2i initiation was associated with a lower risk of hyperkalemia (hazard ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82-0.96]). SGLT2i users had a significantly lower rate of RAASi discontinuation compared to nonusers (36% vs 45%; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). This cohort study demonstrated that, among individuals with diabetes, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease who were receiving a RAASi, SGLT2i initiation was associated with a lower risk of hyperkalemia and RAASi discontinuation.",
      "laySummary": "This study looked at whether adding SGLT2 inhibitors (a type of diabetes drug) to medications already used to treat conditions like heart failure and kidney disease increased the risk of high potassium levels (hyperkalemia). Researchers found that adding SGLT2 inhibitors actually lowered the risk of hyperkalemia in these patients and also reduced the need to stop their RAAS inhibitors. This suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors may be a safe and beneficial addition to treatment plans for people with these conditions."

      "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension remains a global health concern and dysregulated aldosterone production is a central mechanism. Lorundrostat, a novel aldosterone synthase inhibitor that reduces aldosterone production, demonstrated efficacy in participants with uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lorundrostat for lowering blood pressure (BP) when added to a prescribed regimen of 2 to 5 antihypertensive medications in adults with uncontrolled hypertension and treatment-resistant hypertension. In this phase 3, randomized clinical trial, adults with uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension, were enrolled between November 2023 and September 2024 at 159 clinic sites across 13 countries. The last date of follow-up was January 24, 2025. Randomization ratio of 1:2:1 to 50 mg/d of lorundrostat for 6 weeks followed by 100 mg/d of lorundrostat for 6 weeks (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;270) if they met prespecified criteria, 50 mg/d of lorundrostat for 12 weeks (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;541), or daily placebo for 12 weeks (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;272). The prespecified criteria included systolic BP of 130 mm Hg or greater, potassium level of 4.8 mmol/L or less, sodium level of 135 mmol/L or greater, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of greater than 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, and less than a 25% reduction in eGFR. The primary outcome was change in automated office systolic BP at week 6 for participants randomized to 50 mg of lorundrostat vs placebo. Adverse events of special interest included dose reduction, interruption, or discontinuation due to events such as hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and reduction in kidney function. Of the 1083 participants, the mean age was 61.6 years (SD, 10.3 years), 508 (46.9%) were female, 311 (28.7%) were Black or African American, 733 (67.7%) were White, and 685 (63.3%) had a body mass index of 30 or greater (obesity). At randomization, 432 participants (39.9%) were taking 2 prescribed antihypertensive medications and 651 (60.1%) were taking 3 or more. For the pooled 50 mg of lorundrostat group (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;808), the least-squares mean change in automated office systolic BP at week 6 was -16.9 mm Hg (95% CI, -19.0 to -14.9 mm Hg) vs -7.9 mm Hg (95% CI, -11.5 to -4.2 mm Hg) for the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, -9.1 mm Hg [95% CI, -13.3 to -4.9 mm Hg]; P&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001). Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and reduction in kidney function were reported more often with lorundrostat vs placebo. In the 50 mg of lorundrostat group with possible escalation to 100 mg, treatment discontinuation occurred in 1 participant (0.37%) due to hyperkalemia, in 1 (0.37%) due to hyponatremia, and in 0 due to reduction in kidney function. In the 50 mg of lorundrostat group, treatment discontinuation occurred in 2 participants (0.37%) due to hyperkalemia, in 2 (0.37%) due to hyponatremia, and in 3 (0.56%) due to reduction in kidney function. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 49.9% of participants (538/1078) and were mostly mild or moderate in severity. The efficacy and safety of lorundrostat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, was demonstrated for lowering BP in adults with uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension.

      "abstract": "Clinically relevant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a common cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) have recently been studied for their role in DDIs. The commonly prescribed antihypertensive angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are known to be eliminated by hepatic OATPs. ARBs are commonly prescribed to patients with reduced kidney function, and kidney disease can result in profound changes to nonrenal drug elimination through reduced hepatic drug transport-mediated excretion. The antibiotic clarithromycin inhibits OATP activity whereas azithromycin does not, making them useful comparators to study DDIs with OATP substrate drugs. To investigate whether co-prescription of ARBs and clarithromycin results in increased adverse events compared to azithromycin and whether kidney function modifies this risk. We conducted a retrospective population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada (2010-2021) using linked health care data for 106,322 older individuals (&#x2265;66&#x2009;years) receiving an OATP substrate ARB (candesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, valsartan) and newly co-prescribed clarithromycin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;32,693) or azithromycin (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;73,629). Primary outcomes were hospital admissions or emergency department visits for hyperkalemia or acute kidney injury (AKI) within 14&#x2009;days of antibiotic prescription. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) were obtained using modified Poisson regression after controlling for eight potential confounders. Pre-specified effect measure modification analysis evaluated whether kidney function influenced these outcomes. Compared to those co-prescribed azithromycin, patients receiving clarithromycin had a significantly higher risk of hyperkalemia (aRR 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-3.18) and AKI (aRR 1.75, 95% CI 1.41-2.17). The risk of hyperkalemia increased as kidney function declined (multiplicative interaction; p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01). This population-based retrospective cohort study provides evidence of OATP-mediated drug interactions between ARBs and clarithromycin that warrants further investigation to guide clinical practice, especially for patients with reduced kidney function.",

To estimate the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of accelerated KRT initiation compared with standard KRT initiation in critically ill patients with AKI. In this economic evaluation, a state-transition model was developed using data from the Standard vs Accelerated Initiation of Renal Replacement Therapy in AKI (STARRT-AKI) trial, a multicenter, multinational randomized clinical trial of critically ill patients with severe AKI conducted between October 2015 and September 2019. Trial data were linked to administrative health databases in Alberta, Canada, to estimate costs and long-term clinical outcomes. The model included 4 health states: no chronic kidney disease, severe chronic kidney disease, KRT dependent, and dead. Costs are reported in 2024 Canadian dollars. Data were analyzed from February 2022 to November 2024. Initiation of KRT. The primary outcome for the economic evaluation was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The QALY is a combined measure of patient quality of life and length of life. Expected costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) were estimated on the basis of 5000 Monte Carlo simulations. A total of 146 patients from the STARRT-AKI trial were included in the analysis, with 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 59.67 [14.5] years; 52 men [71.3%]) randomized to receive accelerated initiation and 73 patients (mean [SD] age, 61.88 [12.9] years; 48 men [65.8%]) randomized to receive standard initiation. Standard initiation was more costly per patient than accelerated initiation (mean [SD], $251&#x202f;370 [$155&#x202f;801] vs $231&#x202f;518 [$183&#x202f;302]) but generated more QALYs (mean [SD] 7.49 [2.03] QALYs vs 6.64 [1.76] QALYs). The ICER of standard initiation compared with accelerated initiation was $23&#x202f;208, with an INMB of $22&#x202f;648 (95% credible interval, $15&#x202f;980-$29&#x202f;316) when assuming a willingness to pay per QALY of $50&#x202f;000. The findings of this economic evaluation suggest that standard KRT initiation may be cost-effective in a Canadian setting, but this finding was sensitive to postdischarge cost trajectories and regional variation in KRT dependence.",
